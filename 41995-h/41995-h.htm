<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Whatever aids in illustrating the spirit of the late great
struggle, through which the nation has so successfully passed,
must be of interest to the American reader. The occurrences of
the late rebellion will ever form a study for the free citizens of the
Republic, of far deeper interest than those of any other event in
the world's history; and few will be content with the perusal of
mere outlines, or of battle descriptions, however vivid, but which
are only repetitions, though of a magnified type, of what the world
has witnessed at almost every decade, since the dawn of civilization;
and hence they will search out details, and incidents,
which will lead them into the spirit of a conflict, to which they
are indebted for their national greatness, material prosperity,
and civil and religious freedom; and those incidents may be
as readily learned in connection with the career of the Private
Soldier, as with that of the Major General.</p>

<p>The simple but touching narratives of one who has survived
the horrors of a rebel prison; or the little hillock which covers
the remains of one of the murdered victims of rebel cruelty, are
far more perfect illustrations of the civilization of the ruling
classes in the South, and the malignity of their character, than
the whole career of the ablest of our commanders.</p>

<p>Thousands of incidents in the life of every soldier, were
they recorded, would be invaluable in illustrating the history of
the late war; but the mass of these will soon be forgotten, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the actors themselves fill unknown graves. Men who, in any
other era, would be singled out, and known as heroes to a whole
nation for their gallant deeds, will pass through life as but one
of millions, and must rest content with a general tribute to the
great mass.</p>

<p>We are now to have a national literature, as well as a national
existence. American writers of romance and the drama, will no
longer seek the antiquated regions of Europe for scenes and
heroes; America has supplied all that is necessary to the most
vivid of pictures; and no pen, even though the plot be fiction,
need ever exaggerate in incidents or descriptions. He who tells
the simple truth, narrates more of the strange and the heroic,
than could be conceived by the fertility of a Dickens, or a
Dumas.</p>

<p>The writer of this narrative, throughout, has adhered strictly
to facts, without any attempt at embellishment. The wild
chases after the Comanches; the stern duties of war; and the
hardships of prison life, have left him little time to cultivate
elegant diction, and as he has an abiding conviction that unvarnished
truth is ever more acceptable than high wrought fiction,
he is content with the simple narrative, which is spread before
the reader in the pages which follow.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER I.</i></h2>

<div class="center">MY FIRST EFFORT AT SEEING LIFE&mdash;A TRIP TO TEXAS.</div>


<p>I have not the vanity to suppose the details of my career in
life, other than as it has been connected with the public service,
would be of the slightest interest to the reader; and, therefore,
I shall not dwell upon them. But I can not but believe that my
adventures in that most dangerous and romantic of all branches
of the service&mdash;while acting the part of a scout&mdash;during the late
long and bloody war against the most gigantic rebellion known
to history, will be read with interest, not only by the patriotic
people of the loyal states, for whom my life was risked, but by
thousands in the South&mdash;violent rebels&mdash;who will, in these pages
first recognize me, in my true character, as a soldier of the
Union; though oft I have partaken of their hospitalities, and been
their familiar companion; and many a rebel officer will, in the
following narrative, for the first time learn that they have communicated
much valuable information to one who was in the
service of the nation against which they had arrayed the whole
power, and chivalry of half a score of powerful and flourishing
states, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the thirty-seventh
parallel of north latitude.</p>

<p>My career as a scout was commenced under Gen. O. M.
Mitchell, who, in 1862, commanded the Third Division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cumberland Army; General Mitchell, who united in himself the
qualities of a noble man, a thorough scholar, and a dashing officer,
and whose death, before the nation could well spare his services,
caused a deep despondency to pervade every loyal breast.
When he was removed from command in Tennessee, I was turned
over to General Rosecrans; who, in turn, on leaving, recommended
me to General Thomas. I have also served with Gens.
D. S. Stanley, George Crook, Lytle, Sheridan, Grant, and Sherman;
so that the reader will not be at a loss to imagine that
my term of service has been an eventful one; and that vanity
does not inspire me to write an account of those wild and
almost incredible adventures, which are naturally incident to
the branch of the service to which I was devoted.</p>

<p>But why engage in the dangerous vocation, and risk life,
amid enemies who, had they known my character, would gladly
have suspended me to the nearest limb? Say, like Shylock, it
was my nature, and the reader has it all. I had been well
trained in such service, having left my home in Ohio, long
since, and migrated to Texas, where I was schooled as a
"Ranger" and hunter&mdash;the latter character being a necessary
accompaniment of the former, as the ranger draws little or no
subsistence from the government, but obeys the injunction of
Scripture, and takes neither brass nor postal currency in his
purse, nor hard tack in his haversack, relying almost entirely
on his trusty rifle, for subsistence, from the first to the last of
his term of enlistment.</p>

<p>But why should an Ohioan, and a printer, be induced to migrate
to Texas, where civilization has but begun, and where
men still fancy that there is something diabolical in the
process of producing books and newspapers? In Texas&mdash;a
land of contrarities, where all is abundance, by the mere
act of nature, or sterility beyond the power of art to fertilize;
where one only looks up stream for water; where rivers
are narrow at their mouths, and wide at their fountains; where
the ground is never dusty, though parched with drouth; where
grass grows green in winter; where neither the horse nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
cow can be tempted to eat corn; where the widest extremes of
heat and cold are often felt in a day; and where the unfortunate
immigrant, if he murmurs, or shows surprise, at all he sees and
feels, is at once pronounced "green from the states," and looked
upon as an object of commiseration? Well, perhaps it is
strange that I should find myself there&mdash;but it is not more
strange than true.</p>

<p>I had been working at my trade in Jefferson City, Missouri,
during the winter of 1858-9, and in the spring resolved to go to
Kansas, which was yet disturbed by factions, and consequently
the very place for one fond of adventure; and, as my nature
prompted me to ramble, I saw no other section half so inviting;
and accordingly, having armed myself, "as the law directs," I
started for the territory on foot.</p>

<p>I had traveled but half a day, however, when I stopped for
dinner at a wayside inn, kept by a plethoric old man, the possessor
of a young wife and half a dozen worthless darkies.
While at dinner, some one rode up to the gate and inquired of
the landlord if there was a young man there, who was traveling
on foot.</p>

<p>"That's my name," I said, and went to the door, to ascertain:
what was wanted.</p>

<p>"Say, young man," said the party, "don't you want to go to
Texas?"</p>

<p>"Don't care if I do," said I.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "my name is Colonel Johnston; I live
twelve miles south of Dallas; I am taking down a drove of
horses, and want help; I will furnish you with a horse, saddle,
and bridle, and pay your way."</p>

<p>In an instant, all desire to visit Kansas, and participate in
the partisan turmoils, which were continually agitating the territory,
"vanished into thin air," and in their stead arose visions
of wild horse chases, buffalo hunts, Indian fights, and a thousand
other "manly sports," which I knew to be the chief sources of
amusement and excitement, in that wild, celebrated region.</p>

<p>"But where were you going?" queried the Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"To Kansas," I replied.</p>

<p>"What were you going there for?" he continued.</p>

<p>"For fun," was my sententious, but truthful answer.</p>

<p>"Well," he responded, "if you want fun, just go to Texas;
that is the place to find it; plenty of all sorts of game, fine
horses, and clever people. It's just the spot for a young man.
If ever you go there, you will like the country so well, that you
will never leave it."</p>

<p>"Hold on, then, till I get my dinner, and I'll go," was the
only reply I stopped to make, till I had satisfied my appetite.</p>

<p>Dinner over, I mounted the animal designated, and we proceeded
to gather up the horses, which had scattered about to
graze, while the Colonel was waiting on me. There were in the
drove an unusually fine lot of northern mares, which Johnston
stated would be very valuable in Texas, besides a number of
magnificent geldings.</p>

<p>As soon as we were fairly on our way, my employer took
care to remind me that his name was <i>Colonel</i> Johnston, and inquired
mine. He then went on to enlighten me, by saying, that,
in Texas, every man of any note had some title; was either
dubbed General, Colonel, Major, Captain, Judge, or Esquire;
that his friends had given him the title of Colonel, though he
had never held any military position, the term being merely
complimentary. He further informed me, that at one time in
his life, he had been a mate on board of a river steamer, and
then began to relate various feats of personal prowess, which at
once inspired me with a high regard for both his physical and
intellectual endowments. He was really a fine looking, robust
man, about thirty-five years of age, of a very generous, and
manly disposition; and but for a superfluity of vanity and self-importance,
was an exceedingly agreeable companion. He had
been in Illinois, settling up his wife's estate, and had taken her
share of the property in horses; and, by the way, one of the
first things he told me was, that he had married a widow.</p>

<p>We traveled fast; I thought <i>very fast</i>; and as day after day
came and went, and we were in the saddle early and late, I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to imagine something must be wrong about the man and
his horses; but I said nothing. On the second day after we
had joined fortunes, he began to deprecate the fact that he would
have to force a sale of a horse in order to raise money; whereupon
I loaned him a sufficient sum (I think about forty dollars
in gold), to take him through. The reader will say that this
was indiscreet on such a short acquaintance, and that I ought
not to have been so free with my money with a stranger. But
it was always a fault of mine to confide in strangers, and in
this case I did not lose anything, though at one time I believed
the chances good to lose all; for Johnston sought a quarrel with
me in the Indian Nation, while near Boggy river, and I detected
him in the act of drawing his six-shooter on me, at a time when
he thought I did not observe him. My rifle was near at hand,
and I quickly had him at my mercy, with my piece leveled on
his breast, and my finger on the trigger. We had differed the
evening before as to which side of the mountain the road went,
and I was found to be in the right. But this was such a trifling
excuse for a quarrel, that I naturally concluded he entertained
the notion of putting me out of the way, and thus get, not only
all I had loaned him, but all I had on my person. My advice to
young men is, not to be too free in showing money to strangers;
nor ought they to do as I have often done, make loans when
there was no way of getting the money back when it is wanted.
In this instance I might have lost every dollar I possessed, and
my life, too, by my freedom in letting a stranger know my resources.
I was green then, but am wiser now.</p>

<p>Our route lay through South Missouri, along a high barren
ridge, for eighty miles. If I remember rightly, we passed no
town till we came to Linn creek, where we crossed the Osage
river, which, I believe, is the head of navigation. It is a small
town but is a very business like little place. As we crossed the
river a little boat steamed away from the landing, loaded, as I
afterward learned, with nineteen tons of deer hides, besides
other peltries and furs. The town is hemmed in by the Osage
range, which although very high and abrupt, should rather be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
called hills than mountains. The rock of this range is a sort
of lava concrete on the surface, while the tops of the ridges and
level benches in the mountains were covered with bowlders, evidently
of volcanic origin, as they have the appearance of having
been melted in a little round-bottomed pot, from which, after
cooling, they had been dumped. This portion of the country
abounds in minerals, especially lead and iron; and it is, perhaps,
the best watered region in the United States; thousands of large,
clear springs burst out from beneath the mountain ranges; but
very few issue from their sides, however, which is somewhat
remarkable.</p>

<p>We passed through Springfield, which at that time was a beautiful
and flourishing little city. A school dismissed while we
were riding through the streets, and from the walls of the large
seminary issued such a swarm of pretty girls, as would make any
young man's head swim with delight as he viewed them. I have
always had a curiosity to go back there.</p>

<p>From Springfield our route was through a good country for
some distance, until we reached Barry county, in which the
land is too poor and rocky to talk about. While traveling
through it, we managed to tear off nearly every shoe from the
horses' feet, and this caused some delay, in getting them re-set.</p>

<p>Getting on our way again, we passed through Cassville. The
country was still so rocky that the geese couldn't walk about
to graze; at least so I concluded, from the fact that I saw
one sitting on a hill-side, some distance from a house, and a
woman carrying it food. The goose made no effort to help
itself, and the woman had to rough it over the rocks the entire
distance.</p>

<p>Crossing the Arkansas line, we reached Bentonville, a very
thriving village in the Ozark mountains; thence we went to
Fayetteville, a town of considerable importance, to the north,
but in sight of the Boston mountain, a spur of the Ozark range.
As we passed through, we met the overland mail stage, coming
at full speed, or at least as fast as mule flesh could move it.</p>

<p>When stages were first put on this line, considerable excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was created in Western Arkansas; it was a new thing&mdash;an
eighth wonder of the world; and to the great disgust of the
"natives," some of the managers and their wives, feeling the importance
of their "posish," put on considerable "style;" and the
popular disgust would manifest itself on every possible occasion,
much to the annoyance, both of employees and passengers. The
children readily imbibed the spirit of their seniors and would
continually reiterate the slang of their parents. On this particular
occasion, as the coach came down a steep hill into the
town, a crowd of little urchins was standing by the roadside,
waiting to see the "sights;" when one of them, a bright looking
boy, but as ragged as only Arkansas children are, elbows and
knees out, with a huge rent in that part of his pants covering the
spot "where mothers smite their young," from which protruded
a piece of muslin very much the color of the surrounding soil,&mdash;shouted
at the top of his voice: "The g-r-e-a-t O-v-e-r-l-a-n-d
M-a-i-l C-o-m-p-a-n-y&mdash;" and was, evidently, going to add something
more, when a huge, muscular, six-footer of a passenger
thrust his head out of the window and yelled: "Dry up, you
little reprobate, or I'll jump out and raise a crowd and clean you
out in a minute." The little urchin and his party, not exactly
expecting such a reception, took to their heels, each with his flag
of truce flying behind him almost horizontally. The sight was
immensely enjoyed by the wearied passengers, who greeted the
retreating boys with roars of laughter. The lumbering of the
coach and the shouts of the passengers so frightened our horses
that we had a stampede for the next five miles, but fortunately,
no harm resulted.</p>

<p>Boston mountain was the next difficulty we had to surmount.
The road over it is fifteen miles long, and the ascent was exceedingly
steep; but there are several steppes, or benches, on the
sides, and these afford good resting places for travelers. Every
acre on these steppes is good tillable land, and would be admirably
adapted to vine growing; while upon the very summit is
one of the finest farms in Arkansas. We stopped here for the
night and were generously entertained, as indeed we always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were; for the people of this State, before the war, were ever
noted for their hospitality.</p>

<p>On the following morning we started down the mountain. The
sky wore a threatening appearance; great banks of clouds
seemed to rise from the horizon, and, as it were, to be sucked
or drawn from every direction toward the mountain by some
powerful current or attraction, until, finally, as we reached the
first bench from the top, they met with such violence that the
concussion seemed to jar the mountain itself, as if it had been
shaken by an earthquake. Peal upon peal of thunder rolled
through the clouds, accompanied by terrific flashes of glittering
lightning, that seemed to leap from heaven to earth, and from
earth again through boundless space. To add to the terrific
noise of the thunder, it bellowed through the mountain gorges,
reverberating from cliff to cliff, like volleys of musketry, and
was accompanied by the sound of creaking boughs, falling trees,
and of rocks loosed by the winds, tumbling from the summit of
the mountain to the abysses below. The falling rain soon accumulated
into torrents, and these added to the din, as they fell over
precipices, until one could scarcely do other than conclude that
harmony had been broken up in the heavens and that the elements
were engaging in one long, desperate, and terrific strife.</p>

<p>We did not stop&mdash;we could not; the storm came sweeping
down the mountain with a fury that was irresistible; and nearly
carried our animals over the cliffs. The clouds themselves
seemed to be falling, for in addition to the torrents of rain which
drenched us, we were closely enveloped in a thick mist which
shut out from our view all surrounding objects. The horses entirely
bewildered, became frantic, and dashed off in all directions,
but chiefly up the sides of the gorge, down which our route lay.
Some were speedily lost to view, while others almost precipitated
themselves down the mountain side, regardless of danger. As
for ourselves, we were powerless, and could only await the dispersion
of the clouds that we might see what to do; and fortunately
we were not compelled to wait long, as the storm was
brief; it however made up in fury what it lacked in duration.
One by one we discovered our horses on the mountain side,
trembling at the giddy hight to which, in their terror, and
while enveloped in fog, they had clambered. To get them down
was a work of no little difficulty and danger, but it was accomplished,
however, without accident, and we sped away for Lee's
creek, a mountain stream which was known to rise with great
rapidity, and when up was not fordable. The prospect of being
water bound in the mountains for two or three days without provisions,
the reader will admit, was not very inviting; and so we
concluded, and we put on our best speed and gained the ford
just in time; for five minutes later and it was a roaring
torrent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"When we first discovered them, they were under full headway, coming around a point of timber; and the next instant they
came down upon us at a charge."&mdash;<b>Page <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.</b></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the foot of Boston mountain we passed through
a little village of sixty or eighty houses, the inhabitants of which
appeared to be settling some question of vital importance to the
community, as they were engaged in a free fight after the most
approved style&mdash;every body being in; and oaths, rocks, clubs,
and pistol-shots were the order of the day. Not receiving any
invitation to participate, and being firm adherents of the theory
that every community should be allowed to settle its domestic
affairs in its own way, subject only to the Constitution of the
United States&mdash;even though that way was a little rough&mdash;we
passed along on our route, through a shower of ill-aimed missiles;
and for once denied ourselves the luxury of engaging in a
free fight.</p>

<p>We crossed the Arkansas river at Van Buren, and stopped
with very good will at a plantation owned by a handsome widow,
whose husband had been an officer in the regular service. Our
entertainment was superb, and at nine o'clock we retired, and,
being wearied, were soon enjoying a profound sleep. Toward
midnight we were aroused by a loud barking in the yard from
half a score or so of dogs. On going to the door I looked out
and discovered a man in the act of turning our horses out of the
lot. Seizing my rifle, I aroused Johnston, and started for the
scene of operations. Luckily the animals were tired, and moved
slowly, so that I was on the thief in a minute; and he, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I was armed, loosed his hold, fired a shot, and fled. I returned
his fire in haste and at random; so the ball did not take effect.
The thief ran down the lane, at the end of which an accomplice
was standing, and in a moment they both mounted their horses,
and were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>At Fort Smith we entered the Indian Nation&mdash;the first we
met being Choctaws. They had long been on friendly terms
with the whites, and traveling through their country was as safe
as, and perhaps safer than, in Arkansas. But few of the Indians
build their houses on public roads, the exceptions generally being
half-breeds. The full Indian always seeks some secluded
spot on which to build. There were some handsomely improved
farms through the country, but they were mostly owned by white
men who had married Indian wives.</p>

<p>We camped out through the Nation, and procured our food,
ready cooked, from the people. The squaws make excellent
bread, and they supplied us bountifully with stewed venison.
One may go to the Indian's house when he will, and he will find
the kettle on and boiling, filled with the choicest meat. I invariably
found the natives kind and obliging, and very reasonable
in their charges. I often left Johnston to wait in the woods for
his rations, while I sat down with the Indians, and enjoyed a
warm meal. They had milk, eggs, and butter in abundance.
All eat soup, succotash, and other "spoon victuals," out of the
same dish, and with the same spoon; not from a scarcity of
either, but from their laws of etiquette. He is regarded as exceedingly
rude who refuses to eat soup from the same bowl with
them, though each is supplied with separate plates, knives, and
forks for the eating of meat, eggs, fruit, etc.</p>

<p>Although I did not discover any malicious disposition among
the natives, I was informed that human life was held very cheap
by them; although they seldom molest white men traveling
through their country, they frequently engage in deadly strife
among themselves. I do not think much of their progress in
civilization as a general thing. Here and there a farm and residence
evinced industry and taste; but on the next, perhaps, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
will see a crowd of grown young men and women, stark naked,
playing marbles.</p>

<p>Their police regulations were well adapted to preserve order.
In every township of six miles square there was a mounted
force of ten men, one relief of whom was almost constantly in
the saddle, traveling the country in all directions; and their mode
of transmitting intelligence from one beat to another was only
excelled by the telegraph.</p>

<p>The country is beautifully diversified with mountains, bold,
rugged, and often isolated, rising from the surface of a level
valley. They are covered with pine and cedar and other evergreens.
The valleys are well adapted to grazing, and hence the
principal wealth of the country is in horses, cattle, and hogs.
We were often stopped at the bridges to pay toll. As the
streams throughout the entire region usually have quicksand
bottoms, it is a great convenience to travelers to have these
bridges, although it is rather disagreeable to encounter a squaw
every few miles vigorously demanding toll.</p>

<p>On Boggy River we were out in the rain for some time, and,
being wet without, we were naturally dry within; and as the
water in the Indian Nation does not possess sufficient consistency
to quench thirst on such occasions, we resolved to procure
some whisky. But how? That was the question. The law
was very strict in prohibiting its importation or manufacture,
and it was not easy to evade it. However, we must procure
some; and, seeing a house at a short distance from the road, we
stopped the horses to graze while I set out on the questionable
mission of purchasing whisky, without knowing what to call it
in Choctaw.</p>

<p>At the house I found no one at home except a squaw so old
that her teeth were worn off even with her gums, and a young
girl&mdash;very pretty, but very shy. I made known the object of my
visit by telling her, in the very best English I could command,
that I desired to purchase some whisky; but she failed to comprehend
my meaning. I thought for a moment, and then concluded
that as they had to smuggle it, perhaps they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
more familiar with bottled liquors, and I said "brandy," but was
still not understood. "Morning-glory," "eye-opener," "whisky-cocktail,"
"gin-sling," "stone-wall," and the names of a host
of other drinks arose in my mind, but were discarded, one after
another, as altogether unknown in that barbarous locality; and
I began to indulge in unavailing regrets that I had not learned
to speak Choctaw before visiting the country. But at this moment
a happy idea presented itself, and I forthwith proceeded to
put it into execution. Up to this time the Indian girl had stood
resolutely in the middle of the floor, as if prepared to dispute
my further advance. I now passed by her, and walked to a
table where there was a gourd. Seeing the movement, she
sprang to it, and filled it with water from a bucket near by, and
presented it to me to drink with every expression of kindness.
Reader, I must own it was a most eloquent temperance lecture;
and, perhaps, had I been alone, I should have made no further
attempt to make myself understood; but Johnston was out on
the prairie, thoroughly <i>drenched</i>, while I&mdash;well, for my part, I
was <i>dry</i>. Pouring the water back into the bucket, I raised the
gourd to my mouth, pretended to take a long drink, then made
a wry face, smacked my lips, touched my breast with my forefinger,
and then staggered a little. In an instant I was understood.
Her black eye sparkled with delight, and she indulged
in a merry laugh. Running out into the yard, she spent some
time looking up and down as if in fear; then hastily entering
the house, she lifted a board in the floor under the table, and
drew forth a quart flask nearly full of the desired article, and
handed it to me. I produced some money to pay for it, but she
put back my hand in an agitated manner, pointed to the path by
which I came, and patted her hands together several times hastily,
which I interpreted into "go quick;" so without waiting to
return thanks which she could not understand, to her evident
satisfaction, I left.</p>

<p>That night we encamped on Boggy River, which, I believe,
divides the lands of the Choctaws and Chickasaws. It is a very
considerable stream, with broad, rich valleys, finely timbered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The land has been but little improved by labor. It was here
that Johnston took it into his head to be "unlawful;" but that
was the only difficulty I ever had with him.</p>

<p>At Boggy Depot we saw a great many Choctaws and Chickasaws
assembled to hold a grand council, and, like all political
gatherings, it was a mixed crowd. Some were gay, some were
quiet, some were noisy, and, despite of stringent prohibition,
some were <i>drunk</i>, and consequently boisterous. This depot is
a great resort for all classes of traders.</p>

<p>From Boggy we traveled through a well-timbered country,
occupied by the Chickasaws. It is not so mountainous as the
Choctaw country, and I do not consider the people nearly so far
advanced in civilization as the Choctaws, but far more docile and
kind in their manners.</p>

<p>We crossed the Red river at Colbert's ferry, when the Colonel
gave a shout of delight as he once more landed in Texas.
My first impressions of the country were not pleasing. For
twelve miles our way lay through a country heavily timbered
and thickly interlaced with vines. A sandy soil, with, once in
a while, a badly-managed farm and shabby log house, did not
agree with my preconceived notions of the State; but after having
traveled twelve miles, the landscape began to change. We
reached high prairies, covered with luxuriant grass, and dotted
with highly-cultivated plantations and beautiful groves. Immense
herds of cattle were seen in every direction, and although this is
not the chief grazing part of the State, there were many herds
of horses, and flocks of sheep interspersed among the cattle.
The soil is black and waxy, and no matter how much the roads
are traveled they are never dusty, but become beaten down, like
a cake of beeswax; and this species of soil extends as far south
as Austin.</p>

<p>We passed through Sherman, a place of great commercial importance
in Northern Texas, which at that time bid fair to be a
large city; and the next place we reached was Dallas, celebrated
for its mills which produce the best flour in Texas. The staple
of the surrounding country is wheat, the soil being peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
adapted to its culture. Northern Texas is settled almost exclusively
by people from Kentucky, Tennessee, and the West; and
there is consequently more energy displayed in that section than
in other portions of the State.</p>

<p>We reached Mr. Johnston's house, twelve miles south of Dallas,
and were welcomed by his wife and daughter. They went
out on the prairie to examine the stock; and as part of the
horses had been represented as belonging to the estate of his
wife's first husband, I naturally expected that the lady would
recognize some of them, and call them by name, or otherwise
particularly designate them; but to my astonishment she seemed
never to have seen any of them before. I now remembered our
haste, and the Colonel's unaccountable excitement at times; and
I could not escape the conviction that I had helped to run off a
drove of stolen horses.</p>

<p>As my contract was now up, the Colonel pressed me to continue
with him; and his solicitations were cordially seconded by
his wife and daughter; but as soon as I had secured a settlement
with him, and received my money, I pushed on to Austin, where
I expected to find employment as a printer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2><i>CHAPTER II.</i></h2>

<div class="center">MY FIRST INDIAN CAMPAIGN.</div>


<p>My expectations of finding employment as a printer, at
Austin, were not realized, and I went back to Bell county, and
turned my attention for a while to horse taming; but it was
not long before there was found more congenial employment for
me. The Kiowa, Comanche, and Kickapoo Indians suddenly
began to wage a most relentless and cruel warfare upon the
frontier settlements. Their first act of barbarity was committed
far down in the country, within a few miles of where I was employed.
About the 1st of May, 1859, a small detachment of
Comanches appeared on the west side of Bell county, stole some
horses, and drove a lance through the body of a little boy about
twelve years of age; the act being done in the presence of an
agonized mother, and of sisters frantic with grief and fear.
The Indians, after mocking their terrified actions, galloped away,
laughing and sneering at their agony. The neighborhood was
at once aroused, and a few men went in pursuit; I, myself, constituting
one of the party. The savages fled toward the mountains,
at the head waters of the Colorado river; and high up
on the San Gabriel, we came in sight of them; and at once the
chase became so hot that the Indians "scattered,"&mdash;always their
last strategic resort. We only succeeded in finding one, a
gigantic fellow, who had long been known on the frontier, and
was recognized by some of the pursuing party, as a famous Camanche
warrior, called Big Foot. True to his own manhood, he
sustained his reputation as a warrior to the very last, and ceased
to resist only as he fell into the rolling waters of the San
Gabriel, pierced with more than a dozen bullets from trusty Texan
rifles. His body was swept away by the swift running stream;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but his rifle, lance, and bow and arrows were captured, and divided
out among the party as trophies. Big Foot was a giant
in size and strength, being about seven feet high, and in all respects
well proportioned; and his loss must have been severely
felt by his tribe.</p>

<p>Their next outrage worthy of note, was the capture of two
beautiful young ladies, named Whitson, whose persons they brutally
violated. The ladies were walking home from a neighbor's
house, where they had been on a visit, when they were suddenly
surrounded by twenty-five savages, who committed the fearful
deed already indicated, and then carried them away into a captivity
a thousand times worse than death.</p>

<p>They lived near Weatherford, on the Brazos river, and after capturing
them, the Indians carried them far out on the Staked
Plains, stripped them, and left them on the open prairie, without
a morsel of food, or a drop of water, and far away from any
civilized habitation. When found they were lying beneath a
little mesquit bush, locked in each other's arms, and quietly
awaiting the approach of death. It was evident that they had
been crazed by hunger, thirst, and cruel treatment, as their
hands and arms were lacerated, as if they had struggled to tear
the flesh from their own limbs. Luckily, we had a skillful surgeon
and physician among our party, who immediately set about restoring
them. We gave them liberally of our clothing and sewed
blankets into skirts, so that they were soon as comfortable as
could be expected. It was about two hours before sundown
when we discovered them on a high plain, between the waters of
the Colorado and the Double Mountain fork of the Brazos; and
I do not think they could have survived more than thirty-six
hours longer if left to themselves.</p>

<p>We started that night and went a short distance, and in the
morning began our journey to the settlements in earnest. On
the Clear fork of the Brazos the party separated; those of us
who belonged down the country taking the route to Gatesville,
while the friends and neighbors of the girls made haste to restore
them to their sorrow-stricken parents and family. It was some
time before they were sufficiently recovered to tell us their heart-rending
story. Although they expressed their gratitude in the
most fervent manner, and their eyes beamed with delight at the
prospect of being restored to their home, their features wore a
sad expression; and although we did all in our power to revive
their spirits while they were with us, they were never seen to
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i032.jpg" width="900" height="524" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"His sufferings were excruciating, and the crackling fire was built so as to throw out a strong heat on his lacerated back."&mdash;<b>Page <a href="#Page_56">56</a>.</b></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a><br /><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>This outrage threw the whole frontier into a frenzy of excitement,
and wherever the story of their wrongs was repeated, it
enkindled a blaze of indignation which only the blood of the
Comanche could quench.</p>

<p>From this time every species of depredation became common.
Horses were stolen; cattle shot; men, women, and children
murdered, and their residences committed to the flames; the
mangled bodies being thrown within and consumed by the devouring
element; and to make matters worse, the people were
unfortunately divided in sentiment, relative to which was the
guilty tribe. One faction, led by the redoubtable John R. Baylor,
ascribed the murders to the Reserve Indians of Texas;
notwithstanding the fact that these tribes were under the care
and supervision of Major Neighbors, a careful, energetic, and
strictly honest agent, who had the roll called frequently; and no
warriors were allowed to be absent from either of the two reservations
without a written permission.</p>

<p>Capt. Ross was the recognized leader of the other party, and
contended stoutly for the innocence of the Reserve Indians,
and alleged that the depredations were committed by the Comanches.
But the fact that Baylor had once been the agent of
the upper, or Clear fork Reserves, caused his statements to be
believed, and secured him numerous followers. Major Neighbors,
the agent of the Reserve Indians, denounced him as a
liar; and this was the cause, and the only cause, of Baylor's
warlike demonstration. Raising about four hundred men, he
marched to the Lower Reserve, vowing vengeance at every step.
He was met about a mile from the agency by a small body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Caddoes, Tonchues,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Wacos, and a skirmish ensued, and Baylor
was handsomely whipped, and compelled to retreat toward
the Clear fork of the Brazos. His men then soon began to
break up in squads, and scatter off&mdash;some to go home, others to
hunt, while a few of the most daring ones pushed out after the
wild Comanches.</p>

<p>While these stirring events were transpiring, Governor Runnells
was not idle. He hastily fitted out a squadron of rangers,
under command of Capt. John Henry Brown, an energetic and
courageous man, who had had a wide experience in previous
contests with the Indians, and was perfectly familiar with the
frontier. This command was mustered at Belton, in Bell
county, and left for the Indian country about the middle of June.
I enlisted for six months, unless sooner discharged, and I presume
the others entered for the same term.</p>

<p>Perhaps a description of our appearance will interest the
reader. Imagine two hundred men dressed in every variety of
costume, except the ordinary uniform, armed with double-barreled
shot-guns, squirrel rifles, and Colt's six shooters, mounted
on small, wiry, half wild horses, with Spanish saddles and Mexican
spurs; unshaven, unwashed, undisciplined, but brave and generous
men, riding pell-mell along roads, over the prairies, and
through the woods, and you will be able to form a correct conception
of a squad of Texan Rangers on the march. In such a
band it is impossible to distinguish officers from privates, as
the former have no distinct dress; and all act alike.</p>

<p>Usually, we encamped in a hollow square, placing our tents
at regular intervals around the outside. The horses were tied
to stakes by a forty foot rope, and allowed to graze outside
the camp until "retreat," when they were led inside, and the
rope shortened. Guards were posted outside the tents, and at
some distance off; while the horse guards were inside the
square. From Belton, we started in the direction of Gatesville,
going up Cow House creek, and crossing the Owl creek
mountains. Encamping on Owl creek, we disposed ourselves
for the night, and felt felicitated at the prospect of several
hours' rest after a hard day's travel; but our hopes were fallacious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>At about two o'clock in the morning, when all were wrapped
in deep slumber&mdash;the previous quiet having been perfect&mdash;we
were suddenly aroused by a terrific scream; the horses surged,
and pranced around their stakes, their eyes glittering, and their
nostrils distended, while they made the air reverberate with
sharp piercing snorts of rage and fear. It became evident that
an enemy of no mean pretensions was upon us; and the men,
springing to their guns, at once prepared for a defense. For
perhaps five minutes the camp was hushed and still; then again
that fearful shriek rang out, and a large panther sprang from a
tree almost over the Captain's tent, seized a piece of raw beef,
which lay convenient, and was off with his booty so suddenly,
that not a shot was fired. The animal was so large and powerful,
that although the beef weighed at least thirty pounds, yet
its flight was not in the least impeded. After indulging in a
hearty laugh, and numerous speculations as to how the animal
passed the guards unobserved, quiet was restored in the camp;
and while most of the men again resigned themselves to slumber,
the old hunters gathered in groups around the camp-fires,
"spinning yarns," and relating remarkable adventures with
"panter," "bar," and catamount, till daylight.</p>

<p>On the following day we passed through Gatesville, and encamped
on the north side of town. The inhabitants insisted on
presenting us with cakes, and pies, in lavish profusion, simply
because, as one old man expressed it, while dealing out a basket
full: "youre gwine whar you wont git no more soon." From
Gatesville, our route lay through the "Cross Timbers," to the
Red fork of the Brazos. We hunted deer, wild turkeys, and
musk hogs; fished in the little streams on the route; had bullfights
at almost every camp; had horse-races, foot-races, and
all sorts of sports; had plenty to eat and drink; and, in short,
a good time generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>About the 8th of July, we reached the Caddoe village, and
encamped at a famous chalybeate spring, the waters of which
are slightly tinctured with salt. It was some time before we
could reconcile ourselves to the drinking of salt water, but as it
was all that was to be had, we were compelled to come to it.
After we had pitched our tents, I was detailed with a squad of
fifteen, to accompany Captain Brown to the agency, where he
had orders to report.</p>

<p>After scrambling over a very high mountain, and getting a
horse killed, and a man accidently shot in the leg, we came in
sight of the agency, where everything appeared to be in a high
state of excitement. Captain Ross, the sub-agent, and Captain
Plummer, commanding the United States regulars, at the post,
had mistaken us for Baylor's men, and had accordingly prepared
for a vigorous defense. The Indians were mustered in the rear
of the regulars, who were drawn up in line, so as to command
the approaches to the palisade fort; while two pieces of artillery,
loaded with grape, were placed so as to sweep the road, by
which we were approaching, and a small body of cavalry stood
prepared to distinguish itself, whenever opportunity offered.
We held on the even tenor of our way, until arriving within
short pistol range, when the troops were dismissed, and all
gathered around us, to know who we were, where we came from,
what we were going to do, and <i>how</i> we were going to do it?
They were glad to see us, and treated us with every kindness.
When Captain Brown explained his business to the Indians, and
told them he had orders to whip Baylor off and away from their
country, they were so delighted, that they could scarcely find
words or means to express their joy. The chiefs of the different
tribes crowded around the Captain, followed by their principal
warriors, and in their eloquent sign language, and in broken
English, expressed their friendship, as manifestly, as the most
polished phrases could have portrayed it.</p>

<p>This was the Lower Reserve&mdash;the upper manifesting a different
temper. Their head chief, Katampsie, possessed a warlike disposition.
Exceedingly suspicious in all his dealings with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
whites, and crafty as a fox, he was not so easily satisfied of our
good intentions. He was at a loss to understand how one portion
of the people of Texas should want to wage war on him,
while another party, claiming to be the troops of the governor,
should come professing friendship to the Indians, and hostilities
to the white men, who had recently paid him a visit. He knew,
and recognized no authority but the United States, and his own
free will. When, therefore, he was informed that we were
ordered to shoot any of his warriors found off the reservation,
he regarded us as open enemies, and he himself was the first to
set our authority at defiance.</p>

<p>After the first interview, we went back to our camp at the
Caddoe village. A few days afterward, Lieut. Tob. Carmack,
with twelve men was sent up the Clear fork of the Brazos, with
orders to scour the river bottom, in every direction, to see that
none of the wild Comanches were lurking in the thick timber
along the river&mdash;a very dangerous service; and we had orders
not to fire a shot in any emergency, unless at an Indian.</p>

<p>After scouting the country a considerable time, we discovered
signs of Indians, of a nature to lead us to believe that we were
in the vicinity of a considerable force of Comanche, or Kiowa
warriors. We struck the trail just before night, and consequently
had but little daylight by which to follow it; and we
consequently left it, and went down near the river bank to
encamp. We tied our horses in a well concealed place, and established
ourselves in a strongly defensive position, by the side
of a bluff, on the second bank of the river, and kindled but a
single small fire, to favor the guard, who had to watch both
camps, and horses; after which we laid down to sleep. I came
on guard, as the first relief, and Old Sharp as the second; and
I was also to stand the last relief, in place of a young man who
was sick; so that the guard duty for that night fell exclusively
on Old Sharp and myself. Sharp was an experienced hunter
and woodsman, and had had many an encounter with the Indians.
He was social and lively, and about forty years of age;
well built, with dark, keen eyes, black hair, and of swarthy complexion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with wiry frame; he was active and brave, and he received
the name of "Old Sharp," not on account of age, but
because of his expression and quaint manner. Never was the
camp safer from surprise, than when he stood sentinel.</p>

<p>Time wore on slowly that night, as it is a lonely task to stand
guard, in the depths of the trackless forests of the southwest,
with no sound reaching the ear, except the twitter of the night
bird, the hoot of the owl, the occasional sighing of a tired
horse, or the breathing of one's wearied companions. Perhaps
the sentinel, at such a time, may find that his thoughts have left
him, and are wandering away amid more pleasant scenes&mdash;by
chance reveling with delighted friends, or lingering around loved
ones at home, who anxiously await his tardy coming. It is a
cruel thing, when one is lost in sweet reverie, to be recalled
to a sense of his isolated and dangerous situation, by the melancholy
howl of a wolf, the agonized screaming of the panther, or,
as is often the case, by the muffled sound of moccasined feet,
stealing around him. Not unfrequently is the sentinel first
made aware of the danger which surrounds him, by the sharp
twang of the bowstring, and the plunging of an arrow deep into
his flesh. I had become wearied with watching on this night,
and my mind was lost in a dreamy reverie; I had done my best
to pierce the gloom of the forest with my eye, in order to detect
the slightest movement; I had listened to every sound, with an
eagerness, which those who have stood sentinel, and have had
the lives of hundreds of their companions entrusted to their
care, can readily comprehend; I saw around me the sleeping
forms of my companions, and felt, and knew, that upon my
watchfulness, and fidelity, depended their safety, and their lives.
My time had passed away slowly enough. Not an unwonted
sound had broken in upon the solemn stillness of the night; and
at length, when my time had expired, I went to arouse Old
Sharp; but had scarcely touched him, when a loud rattling of
rocks at the water edge, brought him to his feet instantaneously.
"What's that?" said he, in a whisper. "Horse loose, I reckon,"
was my reply, in an undertone, and leaving Sharp on guard, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
slipped down to the river bank, which was here about eight feet
high, and perpendicular. I was advancing rapidly, with my
left hand raised before me, to protect my face from overhanging
boughs, and my right on the stock of my "Navy Six," when the
sound of rattling rocks was repeated, but I failed to detect the
hard ring of horses' hoofs, and I therefore at once concluded an
Indian was secreted in the vicinity. I was going rapidly toward
the sound, which, in turn, seemed to approach me, when I suddenly
stepped over the bank down on the hard rocks, and found myself
confronted by a full grown black bear; indeed, I had almost
fallen on his head.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet without delay, and drew my pistol as
quickly as possible, but it was too late. Just as I regained my
feet, the bear reared upon his hind legs, bellowed piteously with
fright, almost turned a back summersault, and then fled precipitately
across the shoal, and into the thickets on the opposite bank
of the river.</p>

<p>Returning to Sharp, he wanted to know what the "row" was,
and I informed him that it was a bear that had made the noise.
"Yes, yes," he replied, "but I allowed you had knifed the 'cuss,'
from the way he 'bellered.'" This was the first time I thought
of my knife, though I then carried a splendid Bowie knife
in my belt. The bear had awaked some of the men by his bellowing,
but as soon as they discovered that no harm had been
done, and that the "varmint" had made his escape, they lazily
rolled themselves up in their blankets and slept again.</p>

<p>Sharp was fully aroused by this little incident, but was not
at all pleased that I had suffered the "bar" to escape. "You
had oughter have knifed him," he insisted; but I was satisfied
to let the bear off with Uncle Toby's address to the fly: "go,
poor devil, the world is big enough for me and thee."</p>

<p>Old Sharp now seated himself on the ranger's chair, that is,
an inverted saddle, and I took a seat beside him, to see what
would turn up next, or if our nocturnal friend would pay us another
visit. The little affair at once roused in Old Sharp's mind
the recollection of many a scene, and hair-breadth escape, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he went on to relate several adventures of his own, with "bar;"
our conversation, of course, being carried on in a whisper; and
he concluded his narratives with: "but la, boy, the bars a'in't
savage in this country like they are furder north; they git
plenty to eat in the southern country, but furder north, 'specially
in the winter season, when pressed with hunger, they git terribly
severe."</p>

<p>By the time he had concluded his stories, I was too sleepy to
continue the confab, so I picked out a good place by the side of
an old log, where there were plenty of dry leaves, for a bed, and
laid down to sleep, although I was some distance from the remainder
of the party. I had been asleep some time, when I felt
a sense of closeness or warmness, and woke up; and judge my
surprise on finding myself entirely covered up with the leaves,
and I felt Sharp's hand upon me, at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Come, my boy," said he, "there is danger here."</p>

<p>In an instant I was on my feet, rifle in hand, ready for any
emergency. "Injuns?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Look thar," said he, pointing to a dark object, slowly retreating
into the shadows of the timber.</p>

<p>Instantly I brought my rifle to bear upon it, when Sharp laid
his hand on my shoulder, saying, in a whisper,</p>

<p>"Stop, boy, thar's Injuns about, and ye musn't shoot."</p>

<p>At this moment, the animal turned around, and came back a
few paces toward us, stopped with one fore foot partially raised,
and glared upon us in an apparently mingled rage and astonishment.
Sharp only tightened his grip on my shoulder, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Look him right straight in the eyes, boy."</p>

<p>Instinctively I did as I was ordered; never moving a muscle,
but gazing straight into those two great, fiery eyeballs. We
stood thus for perhaps twenty seconds, when the animal, putting
its foot softly to the ground, stepped half a dozen paces toward
us, and stooped upon its hinder legs for a moment, while its
tail moved gracefully to and fro. It eyed us thus for perhaps
five seconds, then turned itself and again retreated into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
depths of the forest, looking back as it went, until it got a considerable
distance from us, when it uttered a scream so loud and
shrill, that it echoed through the woods like the shriek of a terrified
woman, except that it was louder than the human voice. It
was a panther of the largest size; and as it disappeared, Old
Sharp relaxed his grasp upon my shoulder, saying slowly:</p>

<p>"I thought that varmint war about to give us some trouble.
Pick up your blanket, boy, and come up where we kin see the
horses, thar's danger here; thar's Injuns in these woods. I've
bin oneasy for some time; wake up t'other chap if you're
sleepy, we must have two men out at onct."</p>

<p>I declined, however, to awaken the sick man, who, though an
agreeable companion and a good soldier, was in too feeble health
to endure the fatigues of so rugged a service. I then informed
Sharp that I was willing to stand with him till morning; and
from that time till daylight nothing occurred to further disturb
the camp.</p>

<p>Early next morning we dispatched our breakfast, mounted our
horses and again struck out on the trail, keeping a good lookout
for Indians. It was scarcely half an hour after sunrise when
we descried a faint smoke curling up through the timber on the
river bottoms, but apparently not in the direction in which we
were traveling. Leaving the trail, we moved directly toward the
smoke at a charge; and as we entered the timber, we could see
ten or a dozen Indians spring up from the ground, rifles in hand,
the whole party scampering off toward a thicket some distance
away. There was no chance to cut them off from the thicket
before they could enter it; but we kept up the charge until we
had come within two hundred yards of it, when we received a
pretty well-directed volley from behind the bushes. We then
hastened to surround the thicket as quickly as possible; but
while we were doing this, the savages mounted their horses, and
charged out upon and over us, I might almost say, for we had
deployed too far to be able to rally in time to prevent it.</p>

<p>Lieut. Carmack rallied his men and made preparations for a
pursuit. We had discharged a portion of our yagers and pistols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in the melee, which had to be reloaded; and one of our men had
received a wound in the arm from an arrow, and two horses had
been hurt in the charge. It was a short job to extract the arrows
from the horses, though they fought and kicked frantically;
but not so with the man. Carmack tried to pull the arrow out,
but it was no go. Next Sharp proposed to try it; he had had
some experience in such matters, having been wounded more
than once with arrows in his time. Opening his hands, he took
the arrow between his palms and began rolling and lifting it, at
the same time. The wounded man whose name was Williams,
sat still on a log and endured the torture heroically. It lasted
a full minute&mdash;this rolling and twisting&mdash;before the dull arrow
had cut its way out of the flesh. His success so elated Sharp,
that he held it up triumphantly, saying:</p>

<p>"Thar, now, I told you so; ef you'd a pulled agin on that
arrer, you'd a did the business for that arm. Do you see that?"
he continued, pointing to where the arrow was bent against the
bone; "now the wonder is, that the spike hadn't a come out the
fust pull you made."</p>

<p>Hastily bandaging Williams' arm, we mounted and commenced
the pursuit. The Indians had headed directly for the Upper
Reserve, now about twelve miles distant. We pursued till we
were satisfied they belonged to Katampsie's band of Reserve
Comanches, when turning, we struck out on our return to the
Caddoe village. While passing through the settlements we
were informed of a great many petty outrages committed by
both Reserves, since their fight with Baylor's party. At one
place they had robbed a man's dwelling; at another, thrown
down the fences, and rode through and trampled down whole
fields of corn; one man had been robbed of a fine mare; several
watermelon patches had been plundered; and in one of the
last-named offenses, we chanced to catch a party; but they
mounted their horses and were quickly off. Not content with
what they could eat, each man had some sort of a sack, and
some of them, two or three, all filled with melons. As they fled
we closed in on them at a charge, but our horses were tired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and no match for their fresh ponies. When the pursuit was at
its hight, they hastily cut their sacks loose from their saddles
and dropped them on the trail.</p>

<p>Not desiring to provoke hostilities with the Lower Reserve,
to which these Indians belonged, we did not fire upon them;
nor did they attempt to fire upon us. They perfectly understood
our orders whenever found off their Reserves; but they
evidently did not fear us much, for when they were high up on
the mountain, one of them turned in his saddle and shouted
back:</p>

<p>"White man's hoss no good; Injun's hoss heap good; white
man no catch um. You go home; hoss heap sick; me see um."
Then, with a loud laugh, he pressed on with his companions.
Carmack did not fancy following them into the mountain, for
there were at least thirty of them; and they would have been
more than a match for us, if they assumed a hostile attitude.
We dismounted here and helped ourselves to the captured melons
and encamped near by for the night. We procured milk
from the settlers in the vicinity; and the women brought us
warm bread, fresh butter, etc., which proved a great treat, as
we had been living for some days on meat alone.</p>

<p>On the following day we rode back to the Caddoe village and
once more found everything in excitement; the cause being a
report to the effect that the wild Comanches had come down on
the Lower Reserve and stolen seventy-five head of horses, and
then made good their escape. Captain Brown, with as many of
his men as could be spared, and a large force of regulars and
friendly Indians, were soon on the trail, while a party of us that
were left, had nothing to do but to rest ourselves and horses
until they returned.</p>

<p>About the first of August, Captain Brown sent Captain Knowlin
to the fork, with similar orders given to Lieut. Carmack, viz:
to fire on any of Katampsie's band who might be found off their
reservation. We had the usual amount of sport all the way up
the Brazos, killing deer, turkeys and antelope in abundance,
together with a venerable bear, so old she was nearly toothless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
We saw no Indian signs until we got within about three miles of
the Reserve line on the east, when we were suddenly attacked
while at dinner, by about ninety Comanches. Our horses were
concealed in a thicket near by, and were not discovered by the
Indians at all, or it would have been impossible for us to have
saved them. We were seated round in a ring, with our smoking
mess pans filled with stewed venison, in the center, when we
were suddenly startled by the long, fierce war-hoop, and looking
up, we saw a large party of Comanches in full war paint and
costume, each with every feather that his vanity, or the custom
of his tribe would prompt or allow him to wear, streaming in the
wind, while their horses were literally bedizzened with paint
and silver plate. The warriors' shields and clothing were likewise
spangled all over with silver; but we had no time to enjoy
this splendid array of barbaric pomp, although it was one possessed
of fearful interest to us.</p>

<p>When we first discovered them they were under full headway,
coming around a point of timber; and the next instant they
came down upon us at a charge. We had barely time to seize
our rifles, which were lying beside us, and spring to the side of
a house near by, when they sent a shower of arrows among us.
We delivered a hasty but well directed volley as we ran, and
emptied seven of their saddles. Staggered and annoyed at
resistance from so small a party, they circled away to a safe
distance, reformed and charged down upon us again; this time
sweeping around us in a complete circle and getting between us
and our horses. But their arrows flew among us harmlessly,
while five more of the assailants fell from our well directed fire.
But they were not yet defeated, and returned upon us a third
time. We were then ordered to aim at their horses, and I think
the bullet of every man must have taken effect, and some must
have got two shots, for we killed fifteen horses, and there were
but thirteen of us in our party.</p>

<p>The Indians now circled away out of sight, around the point
of timber where we had first observed them, and did not return.
Presently we saw a runner start for the village at full speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and in about half an hour we could see squaws and boys carrying
guns and shot pouches to the Indians in the timber. Seeing
this the Lieutenant inquired:</p>

<p>"What do you say, boys, shall we fight with them?"</p>

<p>"Fight them," was the answer on all sides.</p>

<p>We had a hope of being relieved by the regulars from Camp
Cooper, and this, with our recent success, made us confident of
victory. By this time we could see the Indians filing around the
point of timber and approaching us on foot, in the fullest confidence.
They moved on toward us until nearly within rifle range,
when they went down into a deep ravine, which ran nearly in a
half circle around the house, and about one hundred and eighty
yards distant from it. It was evident from their deliberate movements,
that they intended to make sure work of it this time, even
if it was slow. For my part, I could almost feel the scalp
slip on my head. The savages followed down the ravine and
were soon within short range, and began to peep over the bank
at us. We kept a close watch but did not fire a gun, for we
were expecting a charge. We kept ourselves well sheltered by
the corners of the house, while the Indians hugged the bank.
Presently the report of a rifle was heard in the ravine, which
was followed by a volley, almost as well delivered as if fired by
disciplined soldiers. Then was heard the war-whoop, and the
fire became general, but irregular&mdash;each man loading and shooting
as fast as possible. We only discharged our rifles when we
saw a sure mark, always taking care that not more than two or
three pieces were fired at a time, holding our loaded guns and
pistols ready to receive a charge; but it did not come, and the
Indians, after keeping up a desultory firing for an hour and a
half, struck out for their village, carrying with them their dead
and wounded.</p>

<p>It was apparent that they had been expecting us, their horses
being ornamented and feathered with great care. Their own
faces were also elaborately painted, and they were decked out in
their most fanciful war dress. After they dismounted they
fought us with Mississippi rifles; and, as evidence of the skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with which they were handled, it is only necessary to state that
over fourteen hundred bullets struck the house, and perhaps as
many more whistled disagreeably near to it. As there were no
loop holes in the house, we were compelled to fight around the
corners, which prevented us from doing as much execution as
we otherwise would have done; but with all this, the savages
were severely punished, as we counted eighteen litters taking off
dead and wounded, and found, beside, three corpses which they
had been unable to carry away.</p>

<p>As soon as they commenced leaving we began to fear they
would be reinforced and return, and we immediately dispatched
a voting man named Gus Sublett, for the Caddoe village for more
men. He was a manly fellow, and would do as he promised&mdash;<i>go
through or die</i>! We immediately began to put the house in
a good state of defense, cutting loop holes on every side, and
covering the roof with raw hides, to prevent it from being
fired by burning arrows. We had two men badly wounded
who claimed considerable attention, as they suffered severely;
one of them, Patrick O'Brien, having received a ball in his hip,
and the other, whose name was Terry, had been shot in the calf
of the leg.</p>

<p>After twenty-eight hours our reinforcements arrived, when we
felt a perfect ability to hold our own; but we were not attacked;
the Indians remaining on the Reserve without any further admonitions.
I do not know that the savages would have left off
where they did, had it not been for the intervention of Major
Lieper, their agent, who appeared on the ground just after the
fight was over; and, on our promise to cease firing, rode over
and had a pow wow with Katampsie, in which the latter expressed
a willingness to "quit and call it even," provided we
would do the same; but Captain Knowlin insisted that Katampsie
should give us six sacks of flour and two hundred pounds of
bacon, as "blood money;" and to this he agreed, but refused to
let more than three of our men go into his village after it.</p>

<p>The Indians then gathered up their fallen braves and returned
in sullen silence to their village; but that silence was not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
maintained, for their women speedily began to "howl" the dead.
This is a regular ceremony among them, at which, in addition
to outbursts of grief and exclamations of sorrow from relatives
and friends of the deceased, all the old crones of the tribe join
in howling over the remains. An Indian "wake" is a noisy concern&mdash;especially
if the deceased is a man of note. A wife crops
her hair off, even around her neck, and scarifies her breasts,
arms, and thighs, as a token of mourning for her husband; and
a daughter undergoes similar manipulations on the death of her
father. The scarifying knife is fixed in the end of a stick, so as
to gauge the cut to a certain depth, generally well through the
skin, in order to form a tolerably broad scar. Although the
process is a severe one, they not only readily endure it, but use
the knife on themselves.</p>

<p>On the day following the fight Sterling White, Sublett, and
myself went into the village after our "blood money." When
Katampsie saw us coming he sprang to his feet, vowing vengeance.
The old fellow had several squaws about his tent, who,
I suppose were his wives, as they all seized hold of him and held
him tightly as soon as they saw us prepare to defend ourselves.
The chief raved and tore, jumped up and down, and cursed us in
Spanish, finally worrying the women down till they were obliged
to turn him loose; when, instead of carrying out his threats, he
quietly sat down on a dilapidated cracker box, folded his arms
across his breast, and appeared for some time lost in meditation.</p>

<p>Again we pressed our demand, when he arose, and in company
with some of his leading warriors, went with us to Major
Lieper, and requested him to fill our requisition from the government
stores, which was promptly done, and we left the inhospitable
village for camp, well satisfied that Katampsie's warriors
were not inclined to back their chief in his hostile intentions
toward the whites.</p>

<p>A small force was left to patrol the country up and down, to
see that the Indians obeyed orders, while the remainder of our
party returned to the camp at the Caddoe village. The men at
the upper agency were left under charge of Captain Knowlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
while Captain Brown, with the main force, went down the country
to guard the more exposed settlements.</p>

<p>While we were near the Caddoe village, a reliable citizen came
into our camp and reported having seen a considerable force of
Indians on Rock creek, a little over twenty miles distant. Judging
from the intelligence received as to the number of warriors,
Captain Brown thought it prudent to prepare for a defense of
his camp rather than to start in pursuit. We were out of ammunition;
and to procure a supply, it was necessary for some one
to go to Belknap, twenty-two miles distant, and it fell to my lot
to be the messenger. It was by no means a pleasant task, partly
because the weather was exceedingly hot, but especially because
all the Indians in that region had come to look upon the Rangers
as enemies. I passed through the agency, and as long as I was
near the regulars I felt perfectly safe; but was a little doubtful
as to personal safety outside of their jurisdiction. About half
way between the agency and Belknap, in going around a short
turn in the road, I met sixteen warriors riding along at a walk.
Instantly the foremost of them strung their bows and unslung
their quivers; but I rode deliberately and boldly up, till within
the length of a lance of them, when one of them made signs for
me to stop, which I did. Four of them tried to ride behind me,
but having seen them string their bows, I refused to let them
pass; at the same time throwing my horse around so that a
gigantic forest tree covered my back.</p>

<p>They affected not to understand me, when I drew my pistol
from my belt, and said to them in Mexican, "<i>parreti, amigos</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and immediately they stopped, with a cunning laugh, and turned
to their chief, as if awaiting orders. The Chief, whose name I
learned was Placido, and who was afterward my firm friend,
seemed to regard me with suspicion. Eyeing me from head to
foot, he asked me some questions in his own tongue; but I told
him I did not understand him; but he went on, delivering a
lengthy discourse, still speaking in Indian; and seemed to regard
me with an air that said, "I know very well what I am
saying, and you must understand it."</p>

now said in Mexican&mdash;"<i>no entiende</i>"&mdash;I don't understand.
He then looked at me, for some time, and inquired my name,
speaking in Mexican, and I told him my patronimic. He then
accused me of being a Texan and an enemy. I understood him
now perfectly; his eyes fairly blazed with malicious anger,
as I deliberately eyed him from head to foot. I began to
think it was a mixed case as to whether or not I passed further
inspection. The savages stood around me, in a half circle,
seemingly determined to know, for certain, all about me; and
at the same time, the lack of a medium to convey ideas, rendered
our situation peculiarly embarrassing, particularly as
they had already begun to show unmistakable signs of hostility.
They held a short consultation in their own tongue, after which
the Chief again asked me my name, speaking in Mexican. I
again favored him with it, but it was evidently not the information
he sought; and he hesitated a moment as if to recall some
forgotten word, when he said:</p>

<p>"Donde vienne usted?" (where do you come from?)</p>

<p>Without hesitation, I answered, "From Fort Arbuckle."</p>

<p>"Por donde vamos?" (where are you going?) he continued.</p>

<p>"To Fort Belknap," was my answer.</p>

<p>"Que quiere alla?" he persisted in inquiring.</p>

<p>I told him I had a "big letter" for Captain Thompson, from
Captain Plummer, and that I was a United States soldier, and
not a Texan; and that I was friendly to them so long as they
were friendly to the United States soldiers; and this being delivered
in a very earnest manner, and tolerable lingo, made some
impression; for, pointing to my drawn pistol, he indicated a desire
to have it returned to its scabbard. I pointed to their bows,
and intimated that I wanted them returned to their quivers.
They looked at one another, and laughed, and then unstrung
their bows, while I, at the same time, put my pistol in my belt.</p>

<p>After expressing great love for the United States soldiers,
and undying hatred to all Texans, they bid me "Adios," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
galloped away; not, however, until they had bantered me for a
horse race and a horse "swap." I watched them till they had
disappeared, and then resumed my journey. I got through all
right, and with my ammunition and carts, returned to Caddoe
Village.</p>

<p>On my way back, I heard most piercing cries of pain, near an
Indian camp; and as it was quite dark, I approached as nearly
as possible, in order to discover whence it proceeded. Riding
cautiously, and keeping on soft ground, I approached within one
hundred and fifty yards of a large fire, from which the shrieks
appeared to emanate, when I discovered about forty warriors in
a circle around a tree to which a prisoner was tied. From his
appearance, I took him to be a Comanche; and his captors were
trying his manhood by threshing him with a raw-hide rope. His
sufferings were excruciating; and the crackling fire was built so
as to throw out a strong heat on his lacerated back. He was
greatly exhausted when I saw him, and he was not bearing himself
with that stoicism which the Indian is supposed to possess.
He was probably put to death that night. His captors were exceedingly
grave, and quiet, during the short time I watched
them; not one moving from his place except the one who applied
the lash.</p>

<p>The victim had probably ventured too far, while following the
avocation of a Comanche warrior, viz.: horse stealing, and had
fallen into the hands of the Philistines, who, although they themselves
might not set a better example, were determined to convince
the unlucky one that it was a great crime to be caught.
Fearing that, if discovered, I might become more than a disinterested
spectator of the scene, and not relishing the idea of assisting
the prisoner in playing his particular role, I rode away
as quietly as I approached, and put out for our camp, in a hurry.
Residents of a civilized country will find it difficult to believe
that I witnessed this scene within three miles of the agency, and
that the actors were Delawares, who have been for years under the
supervision of the United States authorities; yet the statement
is as true as it is lamentable.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER III.</i></h2>

<div class="center">MORE ADVENTURE&mdash;MUSTERED OUT.</div>


<p>The people on the frontier became daily more and more incensed
against the Indians; and although they knew the government
intended to remove them at the earliest practicable moment,
to the head waters of the False Washita river, it required
the utmost vigilance to keep citizens off the Reserves and the
Indians on them. At length the preparations for the removal
were complete, and on the 15th of August, 1859, the march to
the Washita agency began. The affair was superintended exclusively
by United States troops, under command of Major Geo.
H. Thomas, now Major General Thomas, who managed matters
in an able manner, and gave complete satisfaction to the people
of the frontier. Every warrior was compelled to be present and
answer to his name, at roll call, in the same manner as the
regular soldiers; and in this way, very few had an opportunity
to drop out and lay back, to wreak private vengeance on the
settlers; nevertheless, fearing that some might escape the vigilance
of the regulars, we had orders to follow up, and arrest or
kill any Indian found straggling more than three miles to the
rear of the column. We had but little to do except exercise
vigilance. One adventure, however, shows the partiality of the
Indian for horse-flesh. We discovered a party of horsemen, one
day, at a distance from us, and near the west bank of the Trinity
river. We were on rising ground, and they had not discovered
us, and we therefore hastily withdrew and took down
the river under cover of the timber, directly toward them; they
were on one side of the river and we on the other. There were
ten or a dozen of them, and were apparently leading more
horses than they were riding. We rode on till within about a
mile of the party, when we could plainly discern that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Indians, and immediately we gave chase. Our horses were put
to their best speed, and we rapidly gained on the savages. One
by one their led horses were turned loose, while the "quirt"<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was
mercilessly used to those they were riding. Soon their baggage
was cut loose and left on the trail to facilitate their escape; and
after this the Indians made much better time, and it became, for
a while, about an even race, we neither gaining nor losing anything;
when at length the Indians began to scatter, with a view
to keeping out of our way till night, when they hoped to escape.
Two of their horses were evidently badly wearied, and were
rapidly "giving out;" and, therefore, Jack Anderson and myself
singled them out and followed them, till they abandoned the
animals, which they did in the mouth of the rocky gorge which
led up into a mountain. The savages were about a quarter of a
mile ahead of us, and consequently when we reached the spot,
they were already far up the side of the mountain, which was
almost inaccessible; and seeing that it would be impossible to
overtake them, we caught the abandoned horses and started for
our rendezvous on the Little Washita river. We were much
wearied, having run our horses, as we afterward discovered,
about thirty-two miles. We had a rough time finding our way
through a strange country to an unknown place during the
night; but it was accomplished. We found about one-half of
the command assembled on our arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>A small detachment was sent out to scout through the country
in the rear of the Indians as far as Red river crossing, while the
remainder lay encamped on the Little Washita, up which stream
we reconnoitered till we reached its head. We then proceeded
across to the head-waters of the Brazos, near the junction of the
Double Mountain fork, where we encamped in an old, deserted
cabin on the waters of the Red fork, picketing our horses on
short rope, and putting out a strong guard, for we had been following
a trail all day which seemed to be about two days old.
During the night we were once more visited by a panther, which
got in among our horses, and made them perfectly frantic with
fear. I was on guard at the time, and as it passed very near
me I was in nearly the same condition as the animals. As it was
between myself and the camp, I dare not shoot without danger
of hurting either the men or horses, so that I was obliged to let
it pass. It walked along very slowly and deliberately, apparently
inspecting each horse separately; when presently, as if
satisfied in its own mind on some important point, it turned and
trotted out over my beat, eyeing me suspiciously all the time.
It made for the timber, and when it got about thirty yards from
where I stood, I blazed away with my shot-gun, which was
charged with heavy buckshot. The panther bounded into the
air, and as it again reached the ground, it whirled its head
around, and bit its side, at the same time uttering most doleful
screams. Knowing that I had done a rash thing in wounding
it in the night, I was considering the propriety of "falling back
on the reserve," when it suddenly seemed to comprehend my
intentions, and started for me. I now saw that there was no
chance for retreat. He cleared nearly half the distance which
separated us at the first bound. Quick as thought I brought
down my gun to fire the other barrel; but before I had time to
pull, half a dozen guns cracked near me, and the panther once
more bounded in the air, and fell again to the earth in the agonies
of death. This was the first time I thought of the camp.
The men in it, having heard my shot, rushed out ready for any
emergency. I was considerably relieved when I saw the panther
fall, but fearing lest he might rise again, I fired my remaining
load into his side. Some of the men brought a chunk of fire,
and we examined the body, and found it literally riddled with
shot. The animal was both large and old.</p>

<p>This was during the last relief, and as daylight was near at
hand, the men did not again go to bed, and I was accordingly
relieved from watch, and I determined to pay my respects to
some turkeys which I had heard for some time "gobbling" in
the distance. Following the direction of the sound I came to a
tree on the bank of a creek, and about three quarters of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from camp. Its branches were literally covered by turkeys&mdash;the
number being not less than forty or fifty. I fired and
brought down two, and was tying their feet together, when in
the distance I heard a yell as if from a single Indian. Now,
thought I, here's for glory; I'm in for a single-handed fight,
and off I started in the direction of the sound, taking good care
to scrutinize every place that could conceal a foe. I advanced
rapidly, but cautiously, for nearly a mile when again the shrill
whoop rang out, but apparently as far off as ever, and in the
same direction. But this time the yell was answered, and by at
least thirty voices. This was decidedly more than I had bargained
for; it was a perfect extinguisher upon my desire to distinguish
myself, and my ambition for a single-handed fight gave
way to apprehensions for personal safety. I felt certain of my
ability to fight and kill one Indian, but I did not care to engage a
greater number, and I struck out for camp in a hurry. Passing
the place where I "hung my turkeys up," I shouldered the
game, and "made tracks frequently." When in camp I threw
down my turkeys, and got soundly lectured by all hands, as is
usual in such cases, for my foolhardiness; after which I reported
to Captain Brown that I had heard Indians. Breakfast was
soon dispatched, horses saddled and mounted, and we started in
the direction of the sounds. After traveling about five miles
we came to another old house, which, although long deserted by
its owner, had evidently been occupied the previous night. A
fire was burning on the hearth, and part of the carcass of a deer
was lying on the ground outside; and there were horse-tracks
all around the door, as if a party had just mounted and ridden
away. Taking their trail, which was broad and plain, we followed
at a gallop nearly all day; at times, however, losing the
trail, and then, of course, consuming time in finding it again.
About noon we passed a herd of cattle, several of which had
arrows sticking in their bodies, and were piteously moaning with
pain. During the day we passed several little piles of sticks
crossed on the trail. The Indians evidently had one or more
prisoners, and the sticks meant that they were to be tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and burned at the stake. This gave our energies a fresh impetus,
and we redoubled our exertions to overtake the party. Encamping
for the night we pushed on again, following the trail,
on the next day, and at about ten o'clock we found where the
Indians had killed a mare, and after taking out her colt, had
devoured it&mdash;a very common habit of the Comanches when hard
pushed by a pursuing party. We hurried along till we came in
sight of the hills at the head of the Big Washita river, having
ridden at a gallop nearly all day. Toward night we came to a
deserted camp which it was evident the Indians had but recently
left; meat was still roasting over the fire on their broiling sticks,
and a gourd was on the ground filled with water from a spring
near by. The water had not yet become warm, though the sun
shone directly upon it. No shoe tracks were found near to indicate
the presence of white persons; all the feet had been moccasined,
and it was also ascertained that one little child was with
the party. We likewise found a strip of calico with a broad
hem on it. Near the camp it was evident that a captive had
been bound, and cut loose in a hurry to escape. After examining
the ground carefully we came to the conclusion that the
prisoner, whoever he might be, was, at least, an Indian, as was
also the little child. We discovered that the savages had scattered
from this camp in different directions, and we found on
one of the trails little bits of paper, strewn along at intervals
for several hundred yards; and a little further along was a pass,
given by Major Leiper to a Reserve Comanche of an unpronounceable
name. Concluding that this was the right trail, we
traveled as fast as our now jaded and starved horses could go
for another two hours, when night came on, and we encamped
on the trail, and rested till morning. We were now on the very
head-waters of the Big Washita, about one hundred and fifty
miles north of Fort Belknap. Our horses were jaded, and we
tired and out of provisions, so that the Captain resolved to
abandon the pursuit, and return to our old camp on the Little
Washita. Traveling leisurely so as to recruit our horses, we arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at our destination, and found Captain Knowlin and his
company anxiously awaiting our arrival.</p>

<p>Having performed the duties assigned to us in that section,
we rested two or three days, and took up our line of march for
Fort Belknap. Heartily tired of an exclusively meat diet, our
lively imaginations conjured up pictures of&mdash;bread and butter;
for which our stomachs longed with a hunger that could be
appeased by bread and butter alone; and this article of diet
constituted the principal topic of conversation all the way to
Belknap. At Fort Belknap Captain Brown received orders to
return to Belton to muster out his men, as they had now accomplished
the purpose for which they were mustered in. We had
glorious times in fishing and hunting all the way back; traveling
all the time just as fancy or caprice dictated, and living off the
best of everything which the country afforded. On our arrival
at Belton the people gave us a hearty welcome, after which we
were honorably discharged; though we had to wait for our pay
till it could be brought from Washington City to Austin, which
consumed several weeks; after which we received it, at the rate
of forty-six dollars per month, in gold.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IV.</i></h2>

<div class="center">WITH THE RANGERS AGAIN&mdash;BUFFALO HUNT&mdash;A LONELY JOURNEY.</div>


<p>I now occupied my time in taming wild horses and hunting,
having an occasional chase after the Indians, until winter, when
I operated with a Minute Company from Burnett county; our
duties being merely to guard the frontier from invasion. A
Lieut. Hamilton was in command of our company, and there was
a <i>chain</i> of companies of the same class, extending along the entire
frontier, numbering nearly twenty-five men each, under the command
of a Lieutenant. They kept up a constant patrol, across
the country rendering it exceedingly unsafe for the Indians to
venture down on the settlements. Nevertheless, their depredations
continued to be of frequent occurrence. The savages
would come in by the mountain trails, on the Colorado river,
until they would get far down in the settlements, when they
would scatter out in small parties of from two to ten, and, by
traveling in the dead hours of the night, they would reach points
which they considered secure; then, by a preconcerted signal,
they would raise havoc in perhaps a dozen different places, at
the same time. This kept the country in a constant fever of
excitement, and, as is usual on such occasions, no one knew who
to trust. Although the Minute Men were ever on the alert, and
zealous in their duty, still the Indians were crafty, and restless
in their hostility toward the whites; and, of course, they often
succeeded in their purposes; and this gave rise to many
complaints against the Rangers; and they were charged with
being careless in the discharge of their duties. The two parties
referred to in a preceding chapter, continued their contentions
without intermission; and while the excitement was at its hight,
the official term of Governor Runnells expired, and Gen. Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Houston was inaugurated in his place. The General was entirely
conversant with the condition of affairs, and the first
thing he did was to organize a regiment of Rangers, under command
of Col. M. T. Johnston, an able officer, and experienced
in Indian warfare; and in addition, he had been engaged in the
Regulator and Moderator war in Texas, and also in the contest
with Mexico, where he had taken part in the storming of
Monterrey. He soon enlisted a fine regiment, which was ably
officered; and the governor and people naturally expected great
success to attend its efforts. Houston's design was to carry the
war into the Comanche and Kiowa country.</p>

<p>I enlisted at Waco, under command of Capt. J. M. Smith,
who was likewise an experienced soldier, and well qualified to
do service in an Indian war. Col. Johnston ordered the different
companies to rendezvous at Fort Belknap, on the 1st of
March, 1860. Our company traveled up the Brazos river from
Waco, where it was recruited, to Fort Belknap, and was the
first on the ground.</p>

<p>A few days before we arrived there, a young woman&mdash;Miss
Murphy&mdash;was carried off from Murphy's ranch, near Belknap.
So secretly had the affair been managed, that not a trace of her
was ever discovered; and all that was known of the presence
of the Indians, was, that a few moccasin tracks were seen in
the vicinity of the house. Miss Murphy had gone to the front
yard for wood, while her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Murphy, was
cooking in the house, with the door leading to the yard, wide
open. The young lady did not return with the wood, and Mrs.
Murphy went out to look for her; but failing to see her, at once
blew the horn, which soon brought the men to the house; but
after the most thorough search, no traces of her could be discovered.
The neighbors were aroused, and the search continued,
but with no better success than on the previous day; though it
was evident that she had been carried off by the Indians. Parties
scoured the country far and wide, in the hope of finding
some traces of her, but she was never heard of more; at least
so long as I was in the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>We had scarcely pitched our tents at Belknap, before a citizen
came into camp with the intelligence that the Indians were
depredating on the settlements but three miles distant. We
mounted in haste, and were soon off. We were not troubled by
delays in putting our army stores in motion, for the reason that
we had no commissary department, and nothing for one to do;
nor was any time consumed in drawing and cooking rations, for
we had none.</p>

<p>We repaired to the place at once, and found that a man named
Peabody had been brutally murdered. He was shot with arrows,
eight or ten times, and then lanced as often, after which he was
scalped. The murder was committed by nine Comanches, in
full view of seven white men, who, had they been worthy of
their race&mdash;of the name of men even&mdash;could have whipped the
savages off, and perhaps saved Peabody's life. They alleged
a fear that a greater number of Indians were in the vicinity; and
so they mounted their horses and left the prisoner to his fate,
in full view of his agonized family, and within fifty yards of his
own home. Having committed the deed, the Indians mounted
and were off, as rapidly as their horses could carry them.</p>

<p>Capt. Smith took prompt measures to secure redress, and inflict
vengeance upon the savages. He confiscated all the flour
in the neighborhood, and put all the women to baking bread.
The murder was committed just at sunset, and we were there
and making preparations for the pursuit by dark; and at daylight
the next morning, were off on the trail, which we followed
with unceasing energy till stopped by darkness&mdash;the Indians, all
the time, flying in the direction of the head waters of the Big
Washita.</p>

<p>The trail indicated that they were traveling leisurely; and as
they took no pains to break the trail, we concluded that they
were young warriors. We encamped for the night, and at daylight
were again in pursuit, as rapidly as horse flesh could carry
us. Our gait, nearly the whole time, was a swift gallop; and
from indications, it was plain that the Indians were accelerating
or "mending" their pace. At dark, we again encamped on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
trail, and near the head of the Big Washita; and we passed the
night without any disturbance; and at dawn were off once more
in pursuit. But now we came to considerable sign, as if there
might be an important village in the vicinity; and following a
path that seemed to be extensively traveled, we wound around
between two high hills, and into a long, narrow valley, within a
short distance of a village containing eighteen lodges. Everything
betokened that the place had been evacuated very recently.
A few horses were staked out to graze near one of the lodges,
and for that point we charged at full speed; and as we dashed
up, we were saluted with the sharp report of several rifles, of
no light caliber; after which arrows fell thick and fast. An
order was then given to surround the whole place. My horse
being somewhat fractious and a good deal braver than I was,
dashed right in among the lodges. Seeing myself in a critical
position, I drew a box of prairie matches from my pocket, and,
lighting them all at once, threw them into one of the dry grass
lodges, and in an instant it was in a blaze; and from it the
flames spread rapidly, till they reached the one in which the
Indians were. The savages kept up a pretty good fire for so
small a number, until they saw the flames, when all was still
as death for a minute or more. Our men ceased firing, to let
me have a chance to get out; but my horse continued unmanageable;
and though, when the heat became intense, he made
a few lunges to escape it, he again wheeled around, gazing at
the lurid flame, heedless of rein, voice or spur.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Indians began to show a disposition to come
out. They made a racket at the door of the lodge, which they
had barricaded, with such lumbering stuff as they could command;
and they were now pulling it down. In the meantime,
our heavy rifle balls were penetrating the grass walls from
every side. Suddenly the Indians raised a piercing whoop, and
five of their number charged out. As they showed themselves,
we discharged more than a hundred guns upon them, and the
whole five fell, either killed outright or mortally wounded; and
four more were killed in the lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>We now took time to examine the place, and discovered that
in many of the wigwams were clothing, buffalo robes, and cooking
utensils&mdash;evidence that the occupants had but recently decamped.
In one of them we captured a large quantity of jerked
buffalo meat, which was about the only thing saved from the
flames.</p>

<p>As soon as the Indians who dashed out were disposed of, one
of the men threw a raw-hide rope over the top of the lodge, so
that it caught on some of the projecting poles, and held fast.
Instantly a party of men caught it, and pulled the frail structure
over; and by kicking the burning grass away, we succeeded,
after a severe scorching, in dragging the bodies of those who
had remained inside away from the flames. Two of them had
been shot dead, and two severely wounded.</p>

<p>We scoured the country for some distance thoroughly, in the
hope of discovering other villages; but all the signs went to
show that there were no more, and that the inhabitants of the
one destroyed had fled before the arrival of the Indians we had
been pursuing, who, doubtless, did not belong there, but had
only fled to it for safety. It is probable that a party of hunters
had seen us long before our arrival, and had raised the alarm;
and as our animals were much fatigued we did not pursue their
trail as the horses ridden by the Indians were, no doubt, all
fresh. We did not recover Peabody's scalp, as it had probably
been hidden by the savages, and was consumed by the fire.
The Indians killed were all Comanches, but the village had been
built and owned by the Wichitas.</p>

<p>We encamped at the spring near the village for a good rest;
and I was soon astonished to find that I was looked upon as a
very brave man; and as such I was highly complimented by my
officers. At first I was somewhat flattered; but I soon remembered
about my horse, and I told them that the credit of the
whole affair belonged exclusively to him; as he had carried me
where it was exceedingly doubtful that I should have gone with
my own free will.</p>

<p>From this place we crossed the Divide, and went down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Red fork of the Brazos. High up on this stream we had a
grand buffalo chase. Keeping under cover of a ridge, we
deployed as skirmishers, so as to surround as much ground as
possible. The wind favored us, and the buffalos did not discover
us until we had marched up over the ridge, and a considerable
distance down toward them; when they began to manifest some
uneasiness, and the Captain at once ordered a charge. As the
notes of the bugle rang out the animals raised their great
shaggy heads in stupefied wonder at the sudden apparition of
three hundred men charging down upon them, yelling, shouting,
laughing, and hurrahing like madmen. With a loud, quick
snort the nearest ones would whirl on their hind feet, and dash
into the herd, spreading panic wherever they went. We soon
closed upon them, and the work of destruction commenced; and
the rattle of firearms was constant. The herd of buffalo seemed
to roll like black waves over the ground, and extended as far as
the eye could reach. The earth was jarred by their heavy,
lumbering gait, while the air was filled with dust, and the ear
stunned by the rumbling sound. On and on we went, pell mell,
until buffalo, horse, rider&mdash;all, brought up with one grand plunge
in the Red fork of the Brazos. The buffalo surging through
the swollen stream, and reaching the opposite bank, scrambled
up it in the wildest confusion&mdash;the strong trampling down
the weak or such as were unlucky enough to fall&mdash;each only
intent upon escape, and only caring for self.</p>

<p>By the time I and my immediate comrades had reached the
river, we found that many of the rangers had become almost
inextricably mixed up with the buffalo, and a few of them were
driven into the water by the struggling mass; but fortunately
they all escaped without severe injury, and joined again in the
exciting, but dangerous sport. Some of the buffalo bogged
down in the quicksand, and were mounted and ridden by a few
of the most reckless of the "boys," at the imminent risk of being
swamped themselves. The sound of the bugle could just be
heard above the din of the chase, calling us to "rally," and we
now, for the first time, surveyed the scene behind us. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
be almost useless for me to attempt a description of the ground
over which we had passed. The dust hung over the plain in a
dense, heavy cloud, but had been lifted sufficiently high to reveal
scores of huge carcasses scattered over the earth, while yet
other scores were rolling upon the ground in the agonies of mortal
wounds; and yet a greater number were staggering and bellowing
under the smart of injuries too trifling to bring them
down, but sufficient to prevent them from keeping up with their
unharmed companions. Here and there, too, was an unlucky
rider, who had been thrown from his horse by accident&mdash;perhaps
the breaking of a rein, or the parting of a girth; and in the
meantime their steeds were flying about, neighing for their company,
or lying down gasping for breath. A few unlucky ones
were in the melee badly gored by the infuriated bulls, and it became
necessary to lead them back to camp; while a few footmen
were seen moving around, pistols in hand, dispatching some
doughty, but badly-wounded animal.</p>

<p>The killed and wounded amounted to more than five hundred;
and when we had fairly rallied, we commenced in earnest to save
the meat. We took nothing but the humps and a few tongues,
leaving the remainder as a feast for wolves. Those who had lost
their horses mounted captured ones, and we were soon off once
more for Fort Belknap. On our arrival, we found the remainder
of the regiment assembled, except one company, commanded by
Captain Ed. Burleson, and which had been in the service for
some time, and was at a point one hundred and fifty miles away,
without an intervening settlement. This wild region we well
knew to be a favorite resort for Comanche and Kiowa hunters,
and, therefore, very dangerous for travelers; yet across it, it
became necessary to carry a dispatch to Captain Burleson, ordering
him to report to Colonel Johnston for duty. I volunteered
for the service, and taking five days rations of bread and bacon,
I commenced my lonely journey, and on the first day made fifty
miles. During the day I passed over a good deal of fresh sign.
There had been a shower of rain in the forenoon, and I crossed
trails where the fresh dust was turned up from under the damp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
soil on the top; but I saw no Indians. I encamped early, as it
was a cloudy night, and I could not see to travel. I ate my
supper, rested awhile, and then moved to a place about a mile
from the road and made my bed in a new place. This is a common
practice among both Indians and Rangers. Feeling perfectly
secure, I slept till morning, and on awaking, looked to
see if my horse was safe, which I soon ascertained was the case;
and then I thought of my breakfast. But judge of my astonishment
when I found it was gone! I soon discovered the fragments
of my haversack at a considerable distance from the tree,
where I had hung it up for safe keeping. It was torn into shreds,
and all my good biscuit and bacon eaten, or carried away. The
hard bread, however, was scattered around; for although a good
article of the kind, it had not proved palatable to my nocturnal
visitor; some of it having been chewed up and evidently dropped
in disgust. My bacon had been completely cleaned out&mdash;had
gone the way of all flesh. There was enough sign on the ground
to convince me that the robbery had been perpetrated by ten or
a dozen "Lober" wolves; none of the black or grey species being
able to reach so high. Imagine my situation and feelings
on making the discovery! A hundred and ten miles from my
place of destination, without a bite to eat, and Indians so thick
around me that I dare not fire a shot, lest I should attract to me
one or more of the straggling bands infesting the country! But
there was nothing to be gained by vain regrets, though much
time might be lost in that way. The contemptible villains that
had robbed me, were, doubtless, at that moment stretched out
in some secluded spot taking a comfortable snooze, or felicitating
themselves upon the successful termination of their enterprise,
and the adroit manner in which it had been executed.
The more I studied over it, the madder I got; so I rode off, pondering
on numerous schemes of revenge. I resolved to hold the
whole community responsible for the acts of the individual, and
have ever since took a great amount of solid pleasure in killing
a wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> was a day and a night getting to Camp Colorado, where I
called upon Lieut. Lee, and related my misfortune. He consoled
me with a hearty meal and I rode on. He also tendered my
mustang a feed of corn, but the pony, not being used to such
coarse diet, refused it in disgust. I had yet twenty-eight miles
to ride before I reached Home creek, where it was supposed I
would find Burleson. The route was easily found to the crossing
of the creek, but when once there which way to turn I did
not know.</p>

<p>About eleven miles from Camp Colorado, I came to a considerable
mountain, called Santa Anna's peak. Staking my pony
so that he could graze, I climbed to the summit to take a view of
the surrounding country, and see if I could discover smoke indicating
a camp. From this point I had a full view of Home
creek, from its source to a point nearly as far down as its mouth,
on the Pecan bayou. While leisurely surveying the landscape
before me, I was startled by a slight sound, like the breaking of
a twig. Knowing that I stood upon dangerous ground, I held
my pistol in my hand; and to cock it was but the work of a
moment; and turning around, judge my astonishment at seeing
before me a stalwart negro, and distant only about ten steps,
with a rifle drawn and nearly ready to fire. There was no mistaking
his intention. His eye was a perfect index to his
thoughts and his determination. Quick as thought I leveled on
him, but before I could speak he addressed me in a very quiet
tone:</p>

<p>"Master, don't shoot me."</p>

<p>"Put down your gun, then," I replied, utterly astonished at
his coolness and effrontery, and slowly he let the hammer fall
and lowered his piece.</p>

<p>"Master," he said piteously, "you isn't gwine to kill me, is ye?"</p>

<p>"What were you about to do to me?" I demanded; "were you
not in the act of shooting me?"</p>

<p>"Master," he replied, "I'se a poor black man; my life ain't
worth nothin' to you, no how; so jes please let me live a little
longer; please don't shoot me."</p>

<p>Again I demanded why he had drawn his gun on me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"O please, sir, put down de pistol, den I kin talk to you."</p>

<p>I lowered the pistol, keeping a strict eye on his movements.
He prefaced his remarks with the very pertinent question:</p>

<p>"Is you from Texas?"</p>

<p>I hardly know what made me deny it, but I replied that I was
not. But his next sentence convinced me that I had done well.</p>

<p>"I thought," said he, "you was one of dem fellers from de
creek, over dar."</p>

<p>"What fellows? Who are they?" I inquired. He looked at
me so calmly, that I saw he was not in the least afraid of me;
and after hesitating a little, he asked, in a dubious tone:</p>

<p>"Master, whar did you come from, den?"</p>

<p>I told him quickly I came from Fort Cobb, in the Indian Nation,
and this seemed greatly to relieve his mind on some important
point, for he said:</p>

<p>"La, master, I thort you was one o' dem fellers from Texas;
dey come up in de mountains every few days, huntin' for some of
us poor brack folks; dey dun cotch nearly all now and took 'em
down in de settlements."</p>

<p>"What is your name, and what are you doing here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My name Jim, sah, and I lives round de end of de mountain,
dar. But, massa, what might I call you?"</p>

<p>I told him my name, and otherwise made myself free with
him, when he became very social; and on learning I was originally
from Ohio, he made many inquiries about the people, and
the country. "I'se always hearn about the north," said he;
"and wanted to go dar."</p>

<p>He then told me he had been raised a slave, and he had run
off from his master, who lived in Jack county, Texas; and
that he had lived in those mountains several years. After talking
awhile longer, and finding I had no disposition to molest
him in any manner, he invited me to go with him to his cave.
Full of curiosity to see more of the strange mortal, I walked
with him around the point, over piles of broken rocks, which
seemed to have been tumbled down out of the side of the mountain,
by an earthquake; he clambered, and I followed, until we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
turned around the spur, when he stopped before a little hole in
the side of a cliff, and pointing to it, said:</p>

<p>"Dar's whar I lib, sah," and he led the way into it.</p>

<p>Stooping down, I followed him into the cave, until he disappeared
in the darkness, when I stepped to one side, and placed
myself behind a huge rock, that projected from the wall. I
thought by doing so, I would have a decided advantage if he
was disposed to be tricky. He then called out: "Jis stop a
minit, till I strikes a light."</p>

<p>He soon had a large iron lamp burning, which lit up the
whole cave; after which, he proceeded to light a fire, and cook
me something to eat. He had plenty to live on&mdash;flour, bacon,
sugar, coffee, and tea. He boasted of this&mdash;said he "lived as
well as de white folks;" but what was the greatest mystery to
me, was the fact that he had a large amount of clothing in his
cave&mdash;both men's and women's wear. In one place, were several
fine coats hanging; and in another, pants, vests, and female
apparel. I kept constantly between him and the door, without
acting as if I suspected anything. But I could not possibly
devise how he came by these articles, and therefore did not like
to put myself in his power, lest my coat might soon hang with
the rest. Without seeming to care anything about it, I asked a
few questions about his hunting, and the profits it brought him;
if he followed trading, and if he bartered any with the Indians.
I found he procured his flour and bacon, by selling game to the
officers and soldiers, at different posts; and that there were a
good many other runaways in the mountains, and that Burleson's
men had caught half a dozen of them, and sent them to
the settlements. I did not deem it prudent to tell him I wanted
to go to Burleson's camp, or that I knew anything about it.
After eating a heavy dinner with him, I bid him a hearty "good
bye," and told him I must ride. He inquired very earnestly
where I was going, and I told him, without hesitating, to Fort
Mason. He accompanied me down the mountain to my horse,
and when I had mounted, he shook hands with me kindly, as
only a negro can, when he is in earnest, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Massa, you won't neber tink hard o' old Uncle Jim; 'deed
I tink you are one o' dem fellers from Texas."</p>

<p>I put out at a good gait, and got to the crossing of the creek,
about an hour before sundown. When there, I had a hard time
to determine which way to go, but finally turned up the creek,
which happened to be the right course, and I reached Burleson's
camp some time after dark, and was warmly welcomed by the
Captain and his men.</p>

<p>On my way down, I had captured a prairie dog, and put it in
my saddle pocket. It was a beautiful little animal, about twice
the size of a common fox squirrel, of brownish color, with very
bright little eyes, and with ears so diminutive, as to be little
more than a curl in the hair. Its feet were shaped like those
of a squirrel, with five toes on its front, and four on its hinder
feet; and its teeth, too, resembled those of the same animal,
but were larger, and stronger; while its tail, except that it was
larger, and had coarser hair, was like that of the common ground
squirrel. It would have made a fine pet, and been an object of
curiosity down in the settlements; but as I could not carry it
with me, I killed it.</p>

<p>The region over which I traveled, abounded in game&mdash;especially
in deer and antelope. On the Clear fork of the
Brazos, I could see immense herds, shading themselves, during
the heat of the day. From the top of the table land, on the
southwest side of the Clear fork, I could see more than fifty
groups of these animals, at once; and many of them numbered
from forty to fifty. It would be altogether safe, to estimate the
whole number in sight at once, at five hundred.</p>

<p>I received a terrible fright from half a dozen horned owls,
just as I was crossing a little creek, within a short distance of
camp. They raised a perfectly demoniac yell over my head,
just as I came up out of the creek; and they followed it up,
with such a natural laugh, that I put spurs to my horse, and ran
a short distance, fearing that I was in the vicinity of a camp of
savages, waylaying the ford. After getting some distance away,
I turned around, and peering up into the trees, discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cause of my alarm to be nothing more dangerous than half a
dozen great horned owls, enjoying a social "time," in the cool
of the evening.</p>

<p>After a day of rest, in camp, I joined a party in a bear hunt,
up Jim Ned creek, a stream named after Jim Ned, a Caddoe
warrior of considerable note, who, as the story goes, is a natural
son of Gen. H&mdash;&mdash;y, who is known throughout the west as a
daring soldier&mdash;gay, and fond of women. He is a man of decided
character, large size, and endowed with no ordinary degree
of courage. His great resemblance to the general, gives
credence to the reputed relationship; but Capt. Beaver, or as
he is commonly called, Black Beaver, a full blood Indian, and a
very truthful man, who has known Jim Ned, since his birth,
says his father was a very black negro, while the mother was a
full blooded Indian woman. Nevertheless, Jim Ned is very
white, and would pass for a white man in almost any crowd.</p>

<p>But without attempting to determine the vexed question of
Jim Ned's parentage, I return to my narrative. Our luck in
the hunt, was extraordinary. We had procured good dogs from
the settlement, and had rare sport. In three days, we killed five
bears, one elk, and a number of deer. We found wild honey in
abundance, of which we partook liberally, after which we filled
our camp kettles with it, as well as every other available vessel
in our possession; some of us even took off our drawers, and,
after having washed them in the creek, tied the legs together
at the bottom, and filled them with the delicious sweet. We
found this decidedly the easiest of all methods of carrying it, as
we could hang it astride our horses. We then returned to camp,
very tired, badly stung, but full of life.</p>

<p>On our return, we discovered everything in commotion, as
the Indians had made their appearance in the neighborhood, and
had been stealing horses; and a party of citizens were in the
camp, ready to pilot us to the scene of the disturbances.
The Captain got his company in the saddle, and went to the
spot indicated that night, and next morning early, we struck out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on the trail, and had only followed it a few miles, when we came
in sight of the Indians, who were only two in number. They
had with them four horses&mdash;none of them good ones. We
raised a yell, and started after them at a full charge. Throwing
themselves from their horses, they turned toward the bushes.
We run partly around the thicket, and commenced firing into it.
Our heavy rifle balls cut the brush and glanced about through
it so much, that it ceased to be much protection to them, and
they soon found it so. They then hoisted a white rag on a
switch, and we ceased firing. The Captain called on them to
come out, which they immediately did, one of them holding his
hand over his right ear. On being assured that we did not
want to kill them, they regarded themselves as extremely well
favored. They belonged to the tribe of Lipans. The citizens
agreed that they would take them to Austin, to be turned over
to Gov. Houston. The wounded man said he was "proud, heap
proud; white man miss so close."</p>

<p>We returned to camp on Home creek, where another party
was sent out to Pecan bayou, on a scout; myself among the
number. A few miles above Camp Colorado, we found a deserter
from the regular service, wandering about in irons. He had a
pistol, and plenty of ammunition; but as his irons were riveted,
he could not get them off. Luckily our blacksmith was along
with us, and he had his rasp with him, by the aid of which, and
his shoeing hammer, the manacles were loosed. When set at
liberty, the Lieutenant told him he might either return to his
regiment, or go down to the settlements; and he chose the
latter alternative. On the same day, we found a negro woman
in the woods, who was taken into custody, to be returned to her
owner: but in the night she escaped, through some mysterious
agency, although securely tied, and was never seen afterward,
by any of the party; and, as catching slaves was not our legitimate
business, we made little exertion to find her. Crossing
over on to Jim Ned, we had plenty of sport, killing deer; indeed,
our horses were literally loaded down with venison, bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
meat, and other game, and we were thinking of anything else,
rather than war, when all at once we struck a broad trail, over
which a large number of horses had passed. Believing that a
drove of animals had strayed off here, from some of the settlements,
we followed in the track, with a view of heading them off,
and returning them to the settlements. As the tracks were
very fresh, we did not anticipate any trouble in overtaking the
drove, the first time it stopped to graze. After following the
trail for some time, we came in sight of a lone Indian, but
nothing else was to be seen. The instant he observed us, he
dashed off as rapidly as his horse could carry him, following the
course the horses had taken. It was evident that he was a sentinel,
and that more savages were ahead; so we started at once
in pursuit. It was now apparent that the animals had been
stolen, and were being driven off by a large body of Indians.
The trail was nearly as plain as a wagon road, and could be
traveled with certainty in the night, and we accordingly kept on
through the darkness.</p>

<p>Failing to gain on the Indian, we cut our game loose from
the saddles, and let it go; and our horses, thus relieved from a
heavy burden, ran well; and though we did not gain on the savage,
we held our own, and thus prevented him from giving the
alarm to his company before we came upon them. It was a
tight race, as long as we were on the level prairie; but as soon
as we entered the mountains, on the Colorado, he frequently
evaded our view, as he was a splendid horseman, and ran his
animal with excellent judgment.</p>

<p>His horse was failing, but so were our own; so that we could
not take advantage of that circumstance. On our arrival at the
top of a mountain we discovered the object of our pursuit&mdash;the
drove of horses&mdash;in the care of about twenty Indians.
They had not yet discovered us, when the red imp before us began
to yell loud enough to awaken the dead, to say nothing
about startling the living. The Indians heard him, and we
could distinctly perceive the excitement occasioned; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at once gave him an answering whoop, and headed the drove
for the river; but the horses not being manageable by so small
a number of drivers, stampeded, and ran to the right, and nearly
parallel to the stream, for some distance; while the Indians,
seeing us gain on them rapidly, left their booty and dashed into
another gap in the mountains. They had lost time in trying to
turn the horses the way they wanted them to go, and we were
now close upon them, firing, and yelling like so many madmen.</p>

<p>On we went till we passed the mountains, when we found the
Indians had mistaken their route, and ran through the wrong
gap, and had unexpectedly found themselves upon the river,
with a high bluff before them, and an almost perpendicular mountain
on each side, while we were charging close upon their rear;
but they hesitated not a moment. Realizing their position, they
spurred ahead, and dashed over the bluff into the river. So
sudden was their disappearance that some of Burleson's men
could not check up in time to save themselves, but went headlong
after the savages, who made for the opposite shore as fast
as they rose to the surface. After swimming a few strokes,
they struck hard bottom and were soon in shallow water, when,
giving us a parting whoop, they fled to the woods, and were
quickly out of sight. The river here is very narrow and deep, on
the North side. The bluff was about sixteen feet high, and perpendicular
above the water. There were three of our party who
went over the bluff after the Indians, one of whom we always
called Towney&mdash;but I have forgotten the names of the others.
They all swam ashore on the opposite side; still, as their guns
and ammunition were wet, they could accomplish nothing against
the long lances of the fugitives, so they wisely followed the
river bank down to a ford and recrossed.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant then concluded to return and save the horses,
as there was no longer any hope of overtaking the Indians in
the dark. We soon found the animals quietly grazing, and encamped
to wait for the return of the men who had gone in search
of a ford, which they found about five miles down the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
We were then forty-five miles from the regular camp; and on
the following day discovered a party of citizens who had gone
out in search of the horses; but had it not been for us, they
would never have seen them again. We then returned, and were
soon feasting on all sorts of wild fowl and game, as well as fish,
of which we caught thousands.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER V.</i></h2>

<div class="center">ANOTHER LONELY RIDE&mdash;FRONTIER FEUDS.</div>


<p>After resting my horse two or three days, I set out on my return
to Fort Belknap alone, as Burleson was not yet ready to
move, and would not be for some time. Out of unadulterated
sympathy for my horse, I took no rations for myself, depending
solely for my subsistence on my trusty gun. There are two requisites
for successful hunting, besides proper equipments and
being a dead shot: one is to find the game, and the other is to
get within shooting distance. I could not dismount to hunt on
foot, nor could I leave my route, lest I should fall in with some
roving band of Comanches; and game was scarce on the high
table-land over which I was to travel, and as a natural consequence,
I went hungry all the way. On the second day, I became
very sick of a fever, which I broke by laying down in a
running stream of pure water until I got chilled; and, between
hunger and sickness, I was unable to travel fast, and it was two
o'clock of the fourth day, before I reached Dobb's ranch, the
first settlement on my way, and only thirteen miles from Belknap.
I called for dinner, and turned out my horse to graze, and, in
the meantime, threw myself down to enjoy a nap, which my
exhausted system greatly needed, and which I could now do,
conscious of perfect security. I had slept but a few minutes,
however, before I was awakened by one of the prettiest girls in
Texas. She furnished me with a towel and a basin of water,
preparatory to taking my dinner, and after indulging in my ablutions,
my appetite attained a keenness which I have seldom
felt; and it was with no ordinary degree of satisfaction that I
seated myself to a table bountifully spread with warm bread,
fresh butter, wild honey, sweet milk, and a score of other dainties,
calculated to appease the most ravenous cravings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
stomach. The young lady sat down immediately opposite me,
and after seeing that my plate was well supplied, she began to
question me as to where I was from, whither I was going, and
to what command I belonged; seeming determined to make me
communicative whether I would be or no. Having fasted long,
I was not unaware of the danger of partaking too freely of the
food set before me; so I measured at a glance just the quantity
I would take, and determined not to exceed it; but the girl kept
on talking, and detained me till I consumed all the victuals on
the table.</p>

<p>Dinner over, I mounted a fresh horse which was furnished me,
and started for Belknap. My steed was a half wild Mustang,
native to the country, and had been badly spoiled in breaking.
I had scarcely touched his back, when he began that species of
rearing and plunging, known in Texas as "pitching;" in California
as "spiking," and in this country as "bucking." Now my
tribulation began. The first half a dozen leaps brought on a
pain, and dizziness, and convinced me of my imprudence in eating
so heartily, after a fast. To dismount, was to evince cowardice,
and the thought was not to be entertained; and, to be
thrown, was everlasting disgrace. The pretty girl was a spectator
of my efforts, and I must ride him or die. Great drops of
sweat were rolling down my face&mdash;the result of pain and sickness,
not of exertion. Seeing the case was growing desperate,
I drove the spurs again and again into his sides, until, almost
frantic with pain, the horse dashed off at the top of his speed,
into the woods, and in the direction of Belknap. I arrived
there in about an hour, still suffering terribly. It does not injure
a man to go three days hungry; I am almost tempted to
say, it may do him good, if he is careful to eat sparingly when
he once more reaches a land of plenty; but I had made myself
a glutton, and must take the consequences.</p>

<p>On arriving in camp, I found that Colonel Johnston had gone
to eastern Texas, and that my company commander, Captain
Smith, had been elected Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment,
and that Sul. Ross, a son of Captain Ross, sub-agent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Lower Reserve, had succeeded him as Captain. Our First
Lieutenant was named Lang, and the Second Lieutenant was
Dave Sublett.</p>

<p>The followers of Baylor were not at all pleased that a son of
their old enemy should have been elected to an office among the
Rangers, although it was not an affair that in the least concerned
them. But a feud of the most violent character disturbed the
community; and among men of the style of those of Western
Texas, hatred almost as inevitably led to personal collision, as
it did in Scotland two hundred and fifty years ago. A single
incident will illustrate the feeling which prevailed:</p>

<p>Some Indians visited the settlements on the Trinity river,
east of Belknap, and commenced at once "raising Cain," as the
frontier men occasionally term it, that is, they helped themselves
to horses and cattle, burned buildings, destroyed crops, and did
all kind of injury which their ingenuity, and a decent regard for
the safety of their persons would permit; and Captain Ross
was detailed with a body of men, to pursue them, and drive them
from the country. We started off on a gallop, and continued it
for some time, till we came in sight of a house, when we slackened
up to a walk, in order to give the party time to get water;
and while at the well, a woman walked out before us, and said:</p>

<p>"You're gwine after the Injuns, are you?"</p>

<p>I was in the advance, and replied politely in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Gwine after the Comanches?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame," I answered.</p>

<p>"Whose company is this?" she next desired to know.</p>

<p>"The Waco company&mdash;Captain Ross," was my response, feeling
a conscious pride in our importance.</p>

<p>"I wish the Injuns may scalp the last one o' you," she shouted
in a shrill voice.</p>

<p>I bowed politely, and the men all broke out into a laugh,
which only increased her indignation; and as long as we were
within hearing distance, her voice rang out maledictions upon
our heads, and upon the heads of every friend of Captain Ross.</p>

<p>We soon found the intruding Indians, who proved to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
band of Kickapoos; and we were not long in routing and driving
them out of the settlements. We did not even get close enough
to fire a gun, so fleet, and so cowardly were the savages, who
fled, at once, in the direction of Red river; and not caring to
weary our horses, with a chase that promised not the remotest
chance of success, we returned to camp.</p>

<p>Soon after, however, another company captured fifteen of
these same Indians, and were returning with them to camp,
when a party of enraged citizens came up, and fired upon the
savages, who were mingled among their captors; so that the lives
of the latter were in as much danger as those of the former; but
luckily, no white men were killed, while two of the Indians were
shot down, one dead and the other severely wounded.</p>

<p>This conduct of the citizens so infuriated the Rangers that
they turned their captives loose, and told them to run for their
lives; then, turning to the citizens, the Captain of the party ordered
them to leave at once, or he would fire on them; and no second
invitation to depart was needed, as the first was looked upon
as very nearly approaching the peremptory; at least, it was a
"broad hint." By that conduct, these settlers only caused to be
let loose upon themselves a dozen or more marauders, who, in
future encounters would have a double thirst for vengeance; and,
who, but for their rashness, would have been disposed of, either
by being sent beyond the limits of the State, or been held as
prisoners till the war was ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2><i>CHAPTER VI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">MORE ADVENTURES&mdash;MEETING AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</div>


<p>About the first of May, the regiment, under command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, set out from Belknap for Camp Radziminski,
an old United States' fortified position, in the Washita
mountains. We traveled hastily, stopping during the first night
on the Trinity river, and on the second, at the Little Washita,
at which latter place, our horses, from some unexplained cause,
stampeded. I prevented my pony from escaping, but the lucky
ones who did this were few. The entire day was consumed in
picking up the fugitives; and by night, only four were missing.
Two of these were the property of Col. Smith, and the others
of private soldiers. On the following morning, I, with three
others, started out to hunt the missing animals, the orders of
the Colonel being, to follow the trail a few hours, and if we did
not see the horses in that time, to give up the pursuit, and go
direct to Radziminski, as rapidly as we could.</p>

<p>We, however, followed the trail over one hundred and fifty
miles. The horses were trying to get back home; and though
turned out of their course frequently, by rivers and mountains,
they would seek the first available opportunity to resume it.
Sometimes they would wander about so while grazing, that we
would be a whole day in striking their trail again. After three
or four days, we found two of the animals, which had got
wound up in the ropes by which they were tied, and were unable
to graze, and hence were nearly starved. We searched the
country for the other two horses, but could not find them, when
my companions with one accord, voted to return to the command,
and let them go; but this I stoutly opposed.</p>

<p>They urged that we had already exceeded our orders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
done better than was expected of so small a party, and that we
were in a country celebrated as an Indian hunting-ground, and
therefore it would be folly for us to proceed further. I told
them to go back, and take the horses, if they wished; but I
should go on; that I could strike the trail again, by making a
circuit of two or three miles; and that I felt satisfied that it
was not more than forty miles to the settlements, in a southwesterly
direction, from where we then were; and to tell the
Colonel that I had determined to continue the pursuit.</p>

<p>About sunset we parted; they commencing a dangerous journey
of one hundred and thirty miles, in a straight line, while I
held on, in the general course the horses had been traveling.
Directly on my route lay considerable of a mountain, which I
ascended. The top of it was very level, and I traveled along
it for about four miles, when I came upon a small trail. It was
now night, but I could readily see by the light of the stars, that
a stake rope had been dragged along the path; and this satisfied
me that I was on the track of the missing horses. I at
once commenced pursuit, until so wearied that I was compelled
to lie down to sleep. On the following morning, I rode on, till
about ten o'clock, when I came in sight of the settlements, the
first house proving to be Murphy's ranch, fourteen miles from
Belknap; and here I learned that the horses had passed the
place, and been taken up in the town, and advertised as estrays.</p>

<p>Well pleased that my long ride would soon be over, and that
I should recover the animals, I made the intervening fourteen
miles with great speed, and a light heart; but alas for human
foresight and calculations! The horses were gone. One had
been ridden away by a Minute Man on a wild goose chase after
the Comanches, while the other had been loaned to a mail carrier,
and had escaped from him, while staked out to graze. On
making inquiry, I learned that a horse answering to the description
of the one which had broken loose, had been seen at Rock
creek, eighteen miles distant; it had on spancels, my informant
said, and a piece of rope was tied around its neck; and I at
once concluded it was the missing animal, and rode out after it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Traveling in the direction of the point indicated, I came to a
noted spring, where I expected to find the company encamped
who had the other animal, but it had gone.</p>

<p>Being very hungry, I staked my horse to graze, while I could
cook some rice, and make a little coffee at the old camp-fire,
which had not yet died out; and while busily engaged preparing
these articles, I was aroused by a short, quick, snort, and in a
moment, the identical animal I had followed so long, came dashing
down the hill at a breakneck speed, foaming with sweat
and terribly frightened; while close at his heels were five stalwart
Indians, on foot, doing their utmost to stop him, and turn
him from his course.</p>

<p>The first thing I did, was to send a load of buckshot among
the savages, and the next, to tie up the frightened animal, which
ran up to mine and stopped; then, changing the saddle from one
to the other, I threw out my rice and coffee and left the spot in
haste. As I started, two or three guns were discharged at me;
but I had no time to stop and inquire the cause. On my return
to Belknap, I ate a hearty supper, and was put in charge of the
mail for the regiment, which weighed about sixty pounds, and
with which I at once left for Camp Radziminski.</p>

<p>The first day out I rode to the crossing of the Big Washita;
and at Soldier creek I formed a mark for an Indian to try his
bow&mdash;the arrow passing very close to my back. I had noticed
for some time the tracks of two Indians, immediately along the
wagon road, but had paid little attention to the matter. But
discovering the presence of danger, I went back about a mile,
and encamped for the night. On the following day I observed
that moccasin tracks were plenty at the spring where they supposed
I would go into camp, from which it is apparent that they
believed me verdant in border warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
knew that they were ahead of me, and felt certain of being
waylaid; and had made certain that they were in a grove, hardly
a mile from the river; and subsequent events evinced that I was
not deceived. As I approached the grove, I left the path, and
rode through the timber some distance away; and after passing
entirely around the grove I again struck the road. After riding
some distance, I turned and went back to a good place, and
secreted myself in a thicket to wait; I had not been there
many minutes when two savages came at a swift run, on foot&mdash;one
about one hundred yards ahead of the other. When the
foremost one was within about sixty yards of me, I fired, the
shot taking effect in his right arm and side. He instantly seized
the wounded limb in his left hand and bounded down the trail,
toward the river, and was soon lost to sight. I followed as
rapidly as possible, but they succeeded in crossing the stream,
and secreting themselves among the bushes on the other side.
Not caring to risk too much I let them go, and went back to the
road, well satisfied that the Indian was mortally wounded and
would die.</p>

<p>I crossed Red river that day, and for the first time lit a fire to
cook; but scarcely had the smoke began to rise, when the wolves
commenced gathering from all points of the compass. Being
tired and desperately hungry, I put a cup of rice on the fire to
boil, and also commenced preparing coffee; but long before the
water was hot, the wolves came so unpleasantly near my horses,
that they refused to eat, although tired and hungry; but came
and stood by the fire where I was.</p>

<p>The wolves kept sneaking up closer and closer, until some
were within ten paces, when I rashly concluded to kill one, just
for sport; and aiming at a very large, gray one, I fired and he
fell in his tracks. No sooner did the others get the scent of
blood than they rushed in from all directions upon their fallen
companion; and I had barely time to seize my cups and jump
on my horse, before they closed in on me from all sides.
Once mounted, I felt entirely safe; and I turned and fired a
charge of buckshot into the pack that was devouring the dead
one; then, wheeling my pony, I rode out from among them.
When at a little distance off I halted my horse and again fired,
this time giving them the contents of a six-shooter, well aimed;
and every animal that received even the slightest wound, was instantly
devoured by the remainder of the pack&mdash;sport for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and I enjoyed it till I was tired, and rode off, leaving the unfortunate
wolves to fight it out. I then rode off, keeping in the
saddle till nearly morning, when I laid down to sleep in a state
of glorious uncertainty as to whether I was on the right or the
wrong road. The road forked on the plain, and I did not know
whether to turn to the right or the left; but after studying
awhile I took the right hand, and laid down to sleep upon my
decision.</p>

<p>A little before daylight, I heard a heavy rumbling sound; and
on awaking, I saw what appeared to be heavy clouds in the distance,
and I at first believed the noise to be thunder; and the
reader may well imagine that a drenching on the open plain was
not a pleasant thing to contemplate. Presently, however, I
concluded the noise seemed to be too suppressed for thunder,
and, as I listened, I discovered it grew louder, and was rapidly
approaching nearer. Springing to my feet, I saddled one horse,
threw the mail-bag across the other and mounted. By this time,
I could plainly discern the cause of the noise; on every side
save one, I was hemmed in by a herd of buffalo. Hoping they
would soon run by, I paused a moment to consider my chances;
and in that moment the avenue for egress was closed, and I was
compelled to run with the herd. They were traveling nearly
in the direction I wanted to go; only gradually bearing a little
to the right. By watching opportunities, I worked over to the
left, and after keeping them company for about two miles, I succeeded
in finding a gap and dashed out, and across a creek, up
which the buffalo were running.</p>

<p>Once safe, I stopped to rest my horses and breathe freely,
for we had been nearly suffocated with dust. I soon discovered
what had started the herd, and was driving it forward with such
speed; in the midst of the herd were a number of Indians,
spearing and shooting with arrows, as if bent on the extermination
of the last buffalo before sunrise.</p>

<p>I was not afraid of being discovered in the midst of such excitement
as the savages were enjoying, if I could only keep my
horses still; and to keep them quiet, I tickled them on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nose until the party was well out of sight, when I rode off, and
in an hour, I found myself at Captain Burleson's camp on Otter
creek, at the foot of one of the Wichita mountains.</p>

<p>The men were delighted with their letters, and they extended
to me a hearty welcome; and, after I had rested a little, I
was furnished with a guide who piloted me to the Colonel's quarters,
some miles away. Lieutenant Colonel Smith was in command,
and he was delighted to know that I had escaped so well,
and congratulated me for persevering so long under discouraging
circumstances, and kindly thanked me for recovering his own
horse, and offered me a pecuniary reward, but this I refused.</p>

<p>Colonel Smith had been exceedingly annoyed at another stampede,
which had occurred on the previous night, in which four
hundred beef cattle had escaped. These being his chief reliance
for food for his men during the approaching campaign, he naturally
felt extremely anxious about the matter; and to add to his
perplexity, while I was yet in his tent, an officer rode up and
said he had followed the trail about three miles, when it was
lost among the buffalo tracks, and that it would, therefore, be
impossible to tell with any certainty in what direction to look
after the missing animals.</p>

<p>At this point, I recollected seeing a trail cross mine, which I
had examined to see if the tracks were those of horses; finding
that they were not, I had supposed that a herd of buffalo had
passed along there, and had left it, without giving it further attention.
I reported this fact to Colonel Smith, who at once
agreed with me that it was the trail of the cattle; and at his
request I mounted a fresh horse and piloted a company of men
to the place. A chase of over fifty miles then ensued, when we
came upon the recreant beasts, and returned with them to camp,
to the eminent satisfaction of at least one man in the regiment&mdash;the
beef contractor. I once more was complimented by, and
received the thanks of, the Colonel, who never withheld praise,
when he believed an action merited it.</p>

<p>The Colonel was now called away on an official visit to some
friendly Indians under the command of Pete Ross, a brother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
my Captain, and I was selected as one of his escort, with a detail
of nineteen others.</p>

<p>While sitting in the tent, a deputation of friendly chiefs arrived
to arrange the preliminaries of the campaign against the
Kickapoos, and judge of my surprise on seeing among the men
the identical one who had been so anxious to convince me that
I was a Texan Ranger, while on the road from the Caddo village
to Fort Belknap. Before me stood Placido, Chief of the Tonchues,
who was now on the most friendly terms with the people
he so lately dreaded, and he gave me a cordial greeting. His warriors,
as well as himself, recognized me instantly as the man
they had catechised so severely; "but, now," they said, "we all
good friends, and go catch 'um Comanche."</p>

<p>I was greatly pleased with Placido. His name was given him
by the Mexicans, on account of his gentle disposition and amiable
deportment; and as I may have occasion to speak of him frequently
in these pages, I will briefly describe him to the reader.
He was about fifty-five years of age, five feet nine inches high,
with black, keen eyes, deep chest; he was also exceedingly muscular,
but not corpulent. When the interpreter told him I was
to be one of the party, he scrutinized me carefully, and, turning
to one of his men, said, in broken Mexican, "'<i>Stah waeno</i>, (<i>esta
bueno</i>)."</p>

<p>Once more the whole party extended their hands, telling me
in half a dozen different languages, that we would be good
friends.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN&mdash;INCIDENTS.</div>


<p>In a short time after this consultation Colonel Smith started
in his campaign against the Kickapoos, who had recently been
busy at all kinds of depredations on the settlements; but their
expeditions had all along been conducted so secretly that they
were not even suspected, until we had nearly reached their
country. We found them well prepared, and they gave us a
warm reception. Just as we were about to leave Camp Radziminski
a terrible storm came up, and the noise of the thunder,
and the flashes of the lightning caused another stampede among
our pack-horses; and just as their speed was at its hight, the
lightning struck "Old Peg," a vicious pack-mule, ever ready to
do mischief in the herd, killing her instantly, and as neatly as
a bullet could have dispatched her.</p>

<p>Old Peg had scarcely fallen when a vicious horse, which always
kicked and pranced after being loaded, as if to see if its
burden was well strapped on, knocked an ax out of a pack, and
as it was whirling in the air, kicked at it, and cut his hamstring,
so that it was necessary to shoot him. The Indians, and not a
few of the white men, seemed to regard this as a bad omen; but
I looked upon it in a more practical light, as a special deliverance
from unruly animals.</p>

<p>On our journey we had bad grass, bad water, bad fare, and
bad luck; the measles broke out in camp, and a large number
of the men became infected and helpless; and in this condition
we reached the Kickapoo territory.</p>

<p>The tribe had mustered all its warriors, six hundred in number;
and it had likewise received reinforcements from the Seminoles
and from lawless, marauding bands of Creeks, amounting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in all, to about two thousand men; and this force, instead of
awaiting an attack, took the offensive at once. Not anticipating
so <i>warm</i> and <i>cordial</i> a reception at so early a moment, at the
hands of so small a tribe, we concluded to decline a meeting; or,
in other words, after holding a council of war, we resolved that
it would be both politic and prudent to skedaddle; and accordingly
we mounted our sick men&mdash;some of them so weak they
had to be fastened on with surcingles&mdash;and started on our retreat.
We commenced our retrograde movement at about nine
o'clock at night, and in the morning we were at Camp Radziminski
once more. We had but three hundred men in this expedition;
but as the Kickapoos had no hope of cutting us off,
and fearing that we would be reinforced, they very wisely gave
over the pursuit. Indeed, throughout the whole affair the belligerents
seemed to be inspired with a mutual fear&mdash;each party
dreading to come to a direct encounter with the other, which
rendered the campaign, on the whole, not a little ludicrous.
When we were in the Kickapoo country we dreaded an attack
from the enemy; and when the savages came in the vicinity of
Radziminski they had a wholesome fear of annihilation there;
and consequently the campaign ended with&mdash;nobody hurt. Our
surgeon and myself once strayed away from the command,
and came nearly being captured; but we escaped, and were the
only ones in the party who were in danger.</p>

<p>It was daylight, in the morning, and we believed ourselves far
enough in advance of the savages to have time to rest a few
minutes, and eat our breakfasts. Awhile before this I had been
sick of a fever&mdash;the result of over-exertion while on a scout&mdash;and
it had fallen into my lower limbs, causing ulcerations; my
feet being so swollen that I could not even wear moccasins. We
had encamped near a beautiful spring, at the house of a white
man with an Indian wife; and I had gone down to fill my canteen,
and bathe my fevered limbs; which I did some distance
from the fountain itself. But some one of the Rangers&mdash;thinking
it a good chance to play a trick on me&mdash;sent information to the
woman that I was washing my feet in the spring; but of this at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the time I knew nothing, nor was I informed of it when I reached
the camp. Entirely without suspicion, I accordingly returned
to the spring for water to make coffee, and on reaching it a very
pretty squaw stepped out from a tree near by, and confronted
me. She spoke in a cheerful tone, but there was a
wicked look in her eye, and one hand was held behind her. Her
glistening eye, and the fact that she concealed one of her hands,
appeared strange; but I was considerably more surprised when
she addressed me in good English:</p>

<p>"Is your name Pike?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered in an off-hand way, and pushed for the
spring.</p>

<p>"What is your name, then?" she demanded, in a suspicious
voice.</p>

<p>"Tom Green; but, madam, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Why, I wanted to see a man named Pike," said she, "who
came down here, a few minutes ago, and washed his feet in my
spring."</p>

<p>It was now a plain case; somebody had been perpetrating a
joke at my expense. But I answered her coolly:</p>

<p>"All right, madam, if you want to see <i>him</i>, I will send him
down as soon as I go up."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," she said viciously.</p>

<p>Up I went, and addressing a messmate, named Moore, told
him there was a woman at the spring, who wanted to see him
immediately.</p>

<p>He took his canteen with him, and started down the path,
while I crept to the edge of the bluff to see what transpired.
There was the squaw, again concealed behind the tree, watching
Moore, who was advancing leisurely without the least suspicion;
and when he was conveniently near, she stepped out,
and demanded:</p>

<p>"Is your name Pike?"</p>

<p>"No," replied he.</p>

<p>"You lie, you son of a gun; didn't I just send a man after
you, to tell you to come down here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The next instant she produced a big hickory club from the
folds of her skirt, and, swinging it high in the air, was about to
bring it heavily down on Moore's head, when he sprang quickly
aside, and drew his pistol, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Look here woman, if you hit me, I'll be dad shammed if I
don't shoot you!"</p>

<p>For a moment the squaw hesitated, and then lowering the club
said:</p>

<p>"If your name ain't Pike, what is it?"</p>

<p>"My name is Moore," said he, in a loud, defiant tone.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "look a-here, I want you to go to camp and
tell Pike I want to see him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Moore, glad to get rid of her; "I'll send him
down right away;" and up he came, laughing heartily at the
joke.</p>

<p>I met him at the top of the hill and motioned for him to keep
still; asking at the same time, who next we should send down;
but our sport was suddenly spoiled by the order to "saddle up."
While this was being done, several of the men went down to the
spring to fill their canteens; and as each filed down the hill, the
squaw confronted him, with,</p>

<p>"Is your name Pike?" each time only to be disappointed; but
requested that "Pike" would be sent down at once.</p>

<p>After having mounted, I rode down to the bluff and called out:</p>

<p>"Madam, my name is Pike; what will you have?"</p>

<p>"O you villain," she shouted; "Is that you? just come down
here, and I'll show you how to wash your feet in my spring;
you dirty villain. Just wait till I get there," she added, in anything
but an amiable voice, "and I'll show you," and she started
for me; but I raised my hat politely, bowed, and wished her a
good day. The last I heard of her was:</p>

<p>"You dirty villain, I'll show you&mdash;" and her angry voice
died away in the distance.</p>

<p>While in camp at Radziminski, an Indian named Bowlegs, (so
called because one of his legs had been broken, and so badly set
that it was crooked), came to me with a very long face, and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
me of a very grave misfortune which had occurred to him. He
had lost his eagle feather and his "big medicine;" and he insisted
that I should go out with him to find them. I readily consented,
and following his trail for thirty miles, in the direction of the
agency, we were successful. I discovered the treasures first,
picked them up, and handed them to him; and never, at any
other time, did I witness such excessive exhibitions of delight.
He danced, and capered, and shouted, like a boy with a holyday
ride in prospect.</p>

<p>The feather and the "big medicine," are prized by the Indian
above almost all other possessions. The feather is, so to
speak, the index to his nobility; and never did Spanish medieval
hidalgo cling with greater pride to the banner of his family,
than does the Comanche to the wild bird's feathers with which
he decks his person. The warrior and his deeds are known by
the feather, almost as particularly as they could be by a written
chronicle of his achievements. If the quill is painted red, it indicates
that the wearer has killed an enemy in battle; if split, it
tells you that two warriors have fallen by his hand; and for each
additional victim to his prowess, another plume is added; so that
you have but to count the feathers, in order to determine, at
least, the number of glorious achievements of the warrior. No
one is permitted to wear a feather until he has been first to
charge up and touch a fallen foe&mdash;been first in at the death; for
those who thus recklessly throw themselves into the breach, are
accounted the bravest; are accounted above the man even, who,
at a distance, brought the enemy down by his bullet.</p>

<p>The "big medicine" was a root about an inch and a half long,
somewhat resembling calamus, and it was bound to the feather
by a strip of red flannel, about a foot long and an inch wide,
and is worn tied to the scalp lock on the crown of the head; it
is regarded as a charm against all the ills "which flesh is heir
to;" and especially renders the wearer invulnerable to the bullets
and arrows of the enemy. I failed to see it in that light, but
took care not to make my doubts manifest.</p>

<p>From this Indian I learned a tradition somewhat after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
order of the one concerning the founders of Rome. Crossing a
plain on our way back to camp, we saw a very large wolf, which
I asked him to shoot with his bow, as he was nearer to it than
myself. He, however, peremptorily declined, saying:</p>

<p>"You shoot 'um; me no shoot 'um."</p>

<p>"Why you no shoot 'um?" I inquired. But he only repeated
what he had said before, with greater emphasis.</p>

<p>I then became curious to know what superstition prevailed in
the tribe to prevent the killing of so mischievous and vicious an
animal; and on putting my inquiries, I learned that there is a
tradition among the Tonchues, that the first of their tribe was
nurtured during his infancy by a she wolf; and that the animal
for this reason is regarded as sacred by that tribe. Where do
such traditions originate? I leave such things to the antiquarian.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">INDIAN WARFARE&mdash;SCALPING&mdash;CANNIBALISM.</div>


<p>About the 20th of May preparations were completed for a
grand campaign against the Indians who occupied the country
near the head-waters of the Red, South Canadian, North Canadian,
Red fork, Arkansas, and Cimaron rivers; the invading forces
to consist of regulars, rangers, and friendly Indians; and upon
the rangers devolved the duty of scouring the great salt plain,
or desert, which disfigures so large a portion of the American
map; and upon which the unlucky traveler or soldier is required
to endure almost every extreme of heat, hunger, and thirst; as
there is no protection from the scorching rays of the sun, no
means of procuring food, and few fountains of fresh water.</p>

<p>While on this expedition, I was sent out on one occasion with
a party of friendly Indians, about thirty in number, under charge
of Casa Maria, a famous Caddoe warrior and chief, to the head-waters
of the False Washita, and thence north-west, across the
divide, between that stream and the Canadian, with a view to reconnoitering
and ascertaining if any of the enemy were lurking in
the vicinity. We were riding along in regular Indian style, with
flankers at every side, and a small guard far in the advance,
when suddenly the latter wheeled their horses and waved a scarf
or handkerchief, as a token that we were in the presence of
danger; and in an instant, flankers and skirmishers came in upon
us at a run, while we of the main body halted to ascertain
particulars.</p>

<p>The advance guard, on arriving, reported that they had discovered
a village of at least a hundred lodges, in the distance;
and from all appearances, they felt convinced that we were
in the neighborhood of a superior force. Casa Maria, not content
to hear the report, repaired at once to the spot, to view the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
scene for himself; but before starting, he required his interpreter
to ask me if I desired to see our common enemy, for myself, in
their houses. I replied in the affirmative, when he turned to his
own men, and pointing back to the agency, addressed them
in Caddoe; and though I did not understand his language, I
judged its tenor, from the fact that the whole party turned for
home, on anything else than a snail's gallop. They looked a
little disappointed, but the word of the chief was law to them;
it was his province to command&mdash;their's to obey.</p>

<p>When they had departed, the doughty Chief, pistol in hand,
made a sign for me to follow him, which I did with eagerness.
He led the way, at a charge, riding over the ridge and down to
the village, at full speed. On, on, we rode, he appeared determined
to storm the village alone. The astounded denizens of
the lodges were unprepared for the spectacle; and not understanding
the character of their visitors, were stupid with wonder,
and gazed in amazement on us, as we almost flew toward
them. Riding to a point so near that we could distinguish their
features, and they ours, a sudden movement convinced us that they
now knew us as we were&mdash;hostile warriors. The men at once
sprang to their arms, and horses; but before they could mount,
we wheeled in a long sweeping circle, at the same time discharging
our pistols among them, and then left them, greeting them
with a long and loud yell of exultation, and the well known
war whoop of the Caddoe.</p>

<p>As we gained the top of the ridge, in another direction from
that in which we first made our appearance, and about two
miles from the village, we cast a glance rearward, to ascertain
what they were doing. We could distinctly see the warriors
mounting in hot haste their steeds; and the squaws and boys
running to and fro with accouterments, suitable for immediate
chase&mdash;everything being in the highest state of excitement. I
now wondered what adventures would next fall to our lot, when
the Chief dismounted, tightened his girth, and motioned me to
do likewise, which I did.</p>

<p>Without exhibiting the least excitement, the Chief stood his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
ground, till he saw the Comanches all mounted; then yelling at
the top of his voice: "whita, whita, por los mugers," and giving
his pursuers a parting war whoop, he struck out in an entirely
different direction from that taken by his men. On we flew,
across the prairie, till we reached a ridge, which we crossed,
after which we turned our course, and ran down a creek in the
course taken by his men; and after flying at half speed, for about
two hours, we reached a creek which emptied into the Washita,
when we slackened our horses to a walk, for ten or fifteen minutes,
after which we again started off at full gallop, to a point near
the mouth of the creek, where we came upon our late comrades,
halted and ready for a fight. Casa Maria at once deployed his
men under cover, after which he sent his horses down into the
bed of the stream, at the same time motioning me to go with the
horse guard. I shook my head, when he called his interpreter,
who informed me that he wanted me to keep at a safe distance,
so that I would receive no injury, as he wanted me to ride quick,
and tell the white men what I had seen. I told him that I
would not go to the rear like a woman, but would bear my part
in the impending battle; and that if I was killed, the other
white men could do as I had done&mdash;come and see for themselves.
He then beckoned me to approach him, and told his interpreter
to inform me that he desired I should keep by his side.</p>

<p>We were all well concealed, behind bushes, rocks, and trees,
lying down as closely to the ground as possible, to await
the unsuspecting Comanches, who believed that they had but
two men to contend with. Nor did we lie long idle. Soon the
enemy, some forty in number, came scouring in, at full speed,
closely following the trail we had made, as if by instinct. On
they came, till they arrived within rifle range, when Casa Maria
drew from his pouch a whistle made from the thigh bone of an
eagle, and blew one long, low note, which was followed up by
three short, quick, piercing ones; and instantly a volley from
Caddoe rifles, greeted the flank of the over confident and unsuspecting
Comanches, who broke in every direction&mdash;some flying
from the field, not to return again. A portion of the savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
however, more resolute than the remainder, soon rallied, and
seemed determined to hold us, till reinforcements arrived from
the village; and they at once commenced a rapid and well directed
fire. But they fought at a disadvantage, as we were
thoroughly protected by our position, while they were compelled
to stand out upon the open ground. They did not dismount, as
is usual; but each warrior rode up within range, discharged his
piece, and galloped off to a place of safety, where he reloaded,
and returned to discharge it again.</p>

<p>A word of command from our Chief, almost instantly changed
the whole aspect of the struggle. The men, on hearing it,
bounded from their places of concealment, and with guns, pistols,
bows, and lances, charged out upon the mounted Comanches.
Arrows flew thick and fast for a brief interval; and rapidly we
were nearing the foe, and a hand to hand encounter seemed
imminent; but before our band had reached the spot where our
enemies stood, they wheeled their animals, and fled from the field,
utterly foiled and beaten.</p>

<p>Once masters of the field, the whistle of the Caddoe Chief
was heard again, and instantly his men commenced disposing
of the fallen Comanches. There were on the ground, seven
killed, and nine wounded; and the dispatching of the latter was
at once commenced. All were slain, and their scalps added to
the trophies of the victory.</p>

<p>Some of the wounded struggled fiercely with lance and bow,
but all were either shot or tomahawked by the infuriated but
exulting Caddoes. Some yielded up their lives with stoical
firmness, chanting their own death song, though suffering the
most intense agony, until the Caddoes would leap upon them,
and, with a blow of the tomahawk, end their torture in a bloody
death. Others begged piteously that their lives might be spared;
but there was no mercy in the breast of the victor for the foe,
though fallen and helpless.</p>

<p>As long as the fight lasted, I could shoot and yell with the
best of them; but, the struggle over and the success complete,
my heart sank within me, and I sickened at the bloody work in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which my comrades appeared to take so great a delight. But
there was no escape for me; I must stand by and witness it all,
without a murmur or a remonstrance. To have interposed an
objection would but have added to the magnitude of the tortures
inflicted; and, perhaps, brought down upon my own head the
vengeance of Casa Maria and his men. That I might, at least,
turn away from the scene, I mounted my horse and rode a short
distance, as if looking out for Comanches, till the work of
slaughter had ended.</p>

<p>Scalping, barbarous as it is, is reduced to an art among the
Indians. The victor cuts a clean circle around the top of the
head, so that the crown may form the center, and the diameter
of the scalp exceed six inches; then, winding his fingers in the
hair, he puts one foot on the neck of the prostrate foe, and with
a vigorous pull tears the reeking scalp from the skull. To the
dead, this, of course, would not be absolute cruelty; but it is
too frequently the case that the process is performed and the
scalp severed while yet the mangled victim lives; and there are
instances where parties have recovered, and long survived this
barbarous mutilation. Occasionally, a warrior is not satisfied
with the part of the scalp usually taken, but bares the skull entirely,
and carries away in triumph even the ears of his victim.</p>

<p>The scalping concluded and the trophies gathered up and secured,
another shrill whistle brought the victors into their saddles,
and we began a precipitate retreat to our own village. For
several miles we marched in solid column; but an order from
the Chief scattered the crowd, and every man took the direction
which best suited his fancy.</p>

<p>I was now once more alone with the Chief. Dismounting, we
suffered our wearied steeds to rest and graze for some time,
keeping a sharp lookout, the while, to prevent surprise. After
the last of his men had disappeared, the Chief mounted his
horse, at the same time pointing in the direction of the Comanche
camp. It was now evident that our enemies had been reinforced,
and were returning to the pursuit. A light gray column
of dust was rising, the cause of which we were at no loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
decipher. We must hasten away or our scalps might soon
grace the lodge of the Comanche, as a compensation for the
losses they had that day sustained.</p>

<p>We rode rapidly in a southeasterly direction till after night;
we came to an elevation which might be denominated either a
high hill or a small mountain, near which was a dense thicket.
Reaching this, Casa Maria again sounded the whistle, the tones
at first being soft and plaintive, but afterward gradually deepening
like the screaming of a frightened bird. It was instantly
answered from the thicket, when we galloped up, and saw Indians&mdash;friends&mdash;rise
up, like Rhoderic Dhu's clansmen, and
greet us.</p>

<p>We laid down to sleep, supperless, and by daylight in the
morning were off again for the agency, at which we arrived
without accident; and here for the first time, I discovered that
half a dozen of the Caddoes were wounded&mdash;some of them severely.
I remained here only long enough to enable my horse
to recruit a little, when I left for Radziminski, to deliver the
Chief's report to the Colonel.</p>

<p>On the following morning, I started back again to the agency,
bearing a message from the Colonel to Placido, who was then
at that point. On arriving at the Tonchue village, I found
everything in a state of deep excitement. A party of wild Indians
had invaded their territory with a view to stealing their
horses; but, being discovered in time, the intruders were driven
off before they had accomplished anything.</p>

<p>A party was just starting in pursuit, and desiring to see the
fun, I secured a fresh horse and started with it at full speed.
We chased the fugitives some fifteen miles out. They numbered
thirteen&mdash;eleven Comanches and two Kiowas, all of whom were
killed and scalped. The bodies of the slain were carried back
by the victorious Tonchues, who made a feast upon them. This
may seem strange to one unaccustomed to the manners of this
and other southwestern tribes; but, shocking as it is, the custom
of eating their enemies slain in battle is almost universal
among them.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I saw the Comanches killed and scalped, I had hoped
the affair would, at least, end there; and when I saw the victors
carrying off the bodies of the slain, I could not conceive of
their motive, for, up to that time, I had not learned that I was
among cannibals; but once at the village, I was not long in discerning
what was to follow. The bodies had hardly been brought
in before the women commenced digging holes in the ground,
over which to cook them. The bodies were disemboweled and
then cut up, and the pieces put upon stakes over the fire and
roasted; after which they were divided out&mdash;every member of
the tribe, even down to the smallest child, getting a share.</p>

<p>At first I tried to avoid seeing the disgusting spectacle; but
when the Indians saw this, they insisted on my presence. During
the cooking, a grand war dance was progressing, at which
all the achievements of the tribe from the beginning of time,
when the little primogenitor of the Tonchues was nurtured at
the breast of a she-wolf, down to the victory of that day, were
duly paraded, and expatiated upon by improvised song, set to
an unearthly music, timed by a monotonous tap, tap, tap, on the
little deerskin drum. A pole was erected and the scalps displayed
upon it, when the grand scalp dance was commenced.
At first, only the warriors who had taken one of these trophies
joined in the ceremony; but afterward the old men fell in, and
gradually the crowd increased until the entire tribe, save the
women, were whirling in circles around the scalp pole.</p>

<p>That portion of the flesh which was not eaten on the ground,
was given out, and taken to the various lodges, for future use,
and to be set before visitors, as a choice delicacy. As I was
sitting beneath the shade of a mesquit tree, three or four venerable
heads of the village came to me, bearing two large pieces
of the meat, which appeared to have been cut from the thigh,
and offered them to me to eat. The flesh was of a rusty color,
and had an unearthly, graveyard smell; and this with the sight
sickened me. I refused the proffered delicacy politely, but
firmly; seeing which, Tocasan, a war chief, and several others
of the principal men, who had been in the chase, gathered about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and said very earnestly; "eat it, Cah-hah-ut," which was the
name they gave me, "it will make you mighty much brave;
mighty much brave."</p>

<p>Seeing that something must be done, I told them I wanted to
go to a house near the agency, where I would get some bread
and milk to eat with it. But no sooner was I out of their
sight, than I buried it, and returned to their dance, which was
every moment getting more and more frenzied. They had
managed, by some means, to secure a supply of whisky, and
their yells and screams, beside other frightful noises, together
with their frantic gestures, made them appear more like demons
than human beings.</p>

<p>In the midst of their excitement, I left them for the night,
and on my return in the morning, found the whole population
completely exhausted, stupid, and almost torpid. During the
day, however, they sobered off, and on the following morning
were ready to join us in a grand circle hunt for wild horses.</p>

<p>This is a peculiar kind of chase; and the only one which
ever results in much success. A column of hunters, consisting
of two or three hundred men&mdash;sometimes even more&mdash;is formed
in the same order as if on the war path, with an advance guard,
and numerous flankers, to look out for horses. As soon as a
herd is discovered, the column is notified, by some preconcerted
signal, when it instantly halts, and awaits the orders of the
Chief, who always rides in the direction indicated and reconnoitres,
accompanied by four or five of the principal men of
the tribe. This done, they ascertain the course of the wind;
and taking advantage of that, march their forces toward the
herd, keeping at a great distance away, so as not to excite alarm.</p>

<p>At intervals of a mile or so, a band of twenty-five or thirty
men will be posted, until the game is entirely surrounded.
These squads again deploy, to right and left, as the movements
of the herd, or the nature of the ground require. When the
circle has been completed, another signal is given, and the ring
is contracted as much as it is possible to do, without alarming
the herd. As soon as the wild horses scent the hunters, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
chase begins. Off go the animals, in the vain hope of escaping
the enemy, which they suppose to be approaching only from
one side; but no sooner do they approach the circle, than
several hunters show themselves, and turn the frightened herd
back again; and thus they are kept galloping across, and
around the sac formed for their reception, for hours, and until
they are so wearied that they are readily taken, by the contracting,
and closing up of the circle. Occasionally these
horses, over frightened, make a desperate charge upon some
single spot in the line by which they are surrounded, and thus
make their escape; but this is not usual. And even then, all do
not escape, for some of them are sure to be lassoed in the
melee.</p>

<p>Our chase was a moderately successful one. We encircled a
herd, and worried the horses, till they were nearly exhausted,
and then succeeded in obtaining a number. As soon as we
had a noose on one of the animals, it was tied and hoppled, and
then let loose, in order to create greater confusion in the herd.
After securing all the best stock, they were driven home, and
turned over to the women and boys, whose duty it is to train
them for the saddle, and otherwise render them serviceable to
the warriors.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IX.</i></h2>

<div class="center">SCOUTING&mdash;A WHITE CAPTIVE.</div>


<p>Col. Johnston, who had returned to his command, now undertook
another expedition against the Kickapoos; and after
marching about two hundred miles through the country and exhausting
a large number of horses, we succeeded in running them
out of the country; and though we had no fight with them, we
effectually prevented further depredations on that part of the
frontier for some time. The only parties who lost their lives by
the expedition were two white men, who were living in a little
cabin on the Big Washita river. They doubtless believed us
hostile Indians and fled; and mistaking them we charged after
and killed both. On learning who our victims were, deep regret
pervaded the entire regiment; but it was unavailing, and we
could only perform decently the last rites due to the departed.
The unfortunate victims of a mistake, were doubtless hunters or
trappers, and perfectly innocent of conniving with the Indians,
in their depredations upon the frontiers. They were, judging
from appearances, but recent settlers in the vicinity.</p>

<p>After our return to Radziminski, the men were allowed to recruit
their horses and rest themselves. During the months of
July and August scouting parties were sent up each of the forks
of Red river, the south and north Canadian, and even to the
Colorado and the Brazos. We had, in these scouts, numerous
adventures, and some exceedingly hard times, as well as a fair
degree of sport. The country over which we traveled is generally
barren and almost destitute of water and timber. The few
springs and streams are filled with bitter or salt water, which is
almost unpalatable. Everywhere rock salt is abundant; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
river banks are full of it, and the waters of the streams are so
impregnated by contact with it, that a man will hardly sink in
in them. As the streams are dry during a portion of the year,
thousands of barrels of pure crystallized salt is left in the
beds, only awaiting the hand of man to gather and use it.</p>

<p>On the head waters of the Colorado, we surprised and burned
a small village, but took no prisoners. Our horses were jaded,
and we could not follow up our successes, or we could have annihilated
the savages who inhabited it. As it was, six or seven
men and one woman were killed.</p>

<p>The Wichita mountains are located between the Red river
on the south, and the Canadian on the north. They are not extraordinarily
high&mdash;the elevation being only from six to fifteen
hundred feet. They are isolated from each other, and do not
lie in a chain or range; but each peak rises by itself, from a
perfectly level plain. The valleys between the mountains vary
in breadth from half a mile to four or five miles; and several
small creeks or rivulets are found running through them, whose
banks are fringed with a luxuriant growth of cottonwood trees;
while other portions of the valleys are covered with the mesquit,
a low scraggy bush or tree, peculiar to southern latitudes.
It bears a long slim bean, which though pleasant to the taste, is
not a fit article of diet.</p>

<p>The most singular thing to me, was that the mountains were
composed exclusively of great masses of dark gray sandstone,
and only covered with a very slight layer of earth; so slight,
indeed, that it could sustain no vegetation save a sickly tuft of
moss or grass, with here and there an exceptional locality;
while the plain in which they stood, is entirely devoid of rock.
In many of these elevations, the layers of stone had a dip of
nearly forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>The plain is covered with the best quality of grass, affording
pasturage for immense herds of buffalo, antelope, and horses.
The mountains and river take their name from a very considerable
branch of the Pawnee Indians, called the Wichitas. Although
long possessing separate political organizations&mdash;if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
aborigines can be said to have politics at all&mdash;the two
branches speak nearly identically the same language, being
able to converse with each other fluently&mdash;an uncommon thing
among savages, after a few years of separation. If the language
of the savage is ever refined, that of the Pawnee and
Wichita must be; at least it is smooth, soft, and very musical.</p>

<p>In this region, game is exceedingly plenty. Bear, otter,
wolves, deer, turkey, etc.; and in addition, poisonous serpents
are numerous and large. These last named are great seekers
after comfort, and are ever hunting out a good bed to rest in.
It is no uncommon thing to find them in the morning in possession
of your best blanket; and sometimes your rather too intimate
bedfellow. As for tarantulas and centipedes&mdash;<i>they</i> are innumerable;
but they seldom do any harm.</p>

<p>The Indians never kill the tarantula; but when it is found in
camp, they carry it away with great care, and let it loose. If
urged to destroy one of them they refuse, on the ground that if
one is killed, its companions will revenge its death, by biting
somebody's horse. The centipede would soon become so numerous
that life would not be safe in Texas, if it were not for another
species of reptile, the lizard&mdash;their active and deadly
enemy. I have seen one of these animals attack a centipede as
large as itself, kill it, and carry it to the top of a tree, and there
devour it at leisure.</p>

<p>On one of our forays toward the head-waters of the Colorado
we killed a white woman, and captured another with her child.
They were in an Indian village, upon which we charged with
great suddenness and violence; and though a portion of the inhabitants
made their escape, all who remained were killed, including
this woman. On seeing us, she turned the horse on which she
was mounted, threw her buffalo robe around her, and covering
her head, shouted, "Americano! Americano!" But the men did
not know her sex, nor understand her words, and in a moment
she fell riddled with bullets. The white woman, who was fortunate
enough to be captured, was taken down to the settlements,
where she was identified as a niece of Captain Parker, an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
frontiersman, who was among the earliest pioneers in that region;
having built himself a fort, which is still known by his
name. He was attacked one night, when this woman was a girl
of nine years of age, and the whole family, except the Captain
and one or two others, supposed to have been killed. His wife
was brutally murdered in the presence of her children. There
were several families in the fort at the time; and but few
of the entire number assembled escaped. The children had all
been taken out on the trail a short distance, and, except this one
murdered.</p>

<p>Although she could distinctly recollect all the details of the
affair, and the form and features of her mother, she had entirely
forgotten her native tongue, and we could only communicate
with her through an interpreter. She happened to have her
youngest child with her, at the time of her capture, which had
been named To-ca-san, for one of the war chiefs of the tribe.
It was about three years old, and violent in its disposition as a
catamount. She informed us that she had one son, who was a
good warrior, and also another boy and girl. She informed us
that she had never seen a white person over nine years old allowed
to live; and that she had been a spectator on numerous
occasions when they had been put to death; and that it was uncommon
to allow even a child to escape with its life. "Their
prisoners," she continued, "are tortured, and then killed and
eaten."</p>

<p>On the 15th of August we left Radziminski finally. All the
men who had lost their horses, or whose animals were unfit for
service, were sent back to Fort Belknap, with quarter rations,
but with sufficient ammunition to enable them to subsist off the
country. After sending away these, Colonel Johnston found
himself with barely one hundred and ten men; and it was with
this small force that he proposed to invade the Indian country,
and teach the savages to respect the property and power of the
white man. The friendly Indians regarded this determination
as the freak of a madman; and the chiefs waited upon him in a
body, in order to induce him to desist from his undertaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
They represented to him the nature of the country through
which he must travel, the scarcity of grass, water, timber, and
game. He might possibly find buffalo, but the chances were decidedly
against it. They also expatiated on the number, power,
and prowess of the Comanches and Kiowas, as well as their desperation;
and they advised the Colonel to fall back on the settlements,
and guard the frontier during the coming winter, and
then renew the campaign in the spring.</p>

<p>"You have already done much service," they said; "and your
horses are not good, and your young men are tired; let us now
go to our own country, and wait for the good grass in the
spring; then we will come and help you fight the Comanches."
But despite their eloquence the Colonel was inexorable; he
would make a campaign at once.</p>

<p>Placido represented vividly the hard fate of his command if it
advanced; how his men must suffer from hunger and thirst; and
how almost inevitable defeat awaited an invasion by so small a
party. But he refused to listen to the words of his friend.
Discovering this, the chiefs united in firmly, but respectfully
informing the Colonel that if he undertook the campaign, it must
be alone; they would not accompany him, as but one result could
attend the expedition.</p>

<p>Colonel Johnston was sorely disappointed at this desertion by
his allies. He had relied upon their co-operation; but that
reliance had proved delusive. When the friendly Indians had
mounted, they parted with every manifestation of deepest friendship;
and, for my part, I felt deep regrets at the separation.
We had long been together, and were really getting attached to
each other. Before leaving, many of them embraced me affectionately;
and the Tonchues insisted on my accompanying them,
their chief, Placido, desiring me to teach his young men how to
read and write. "If you will do this," said he, "I will give you
all my ponies when I die;" all his wealth was in these animals,
the number owned by him being about four hundred.
I informed him that I would go to his village at some other time;
but at present I could not accompany him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," they said, "we will never see Cah-hah-ut<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> again."</p>

<p>Six of the Indians, notwithstanding the determination of the
main body, determined to remain with us, and share our fortunes.
They were, "Jack," a Shawnee; "Black Foot," a Delaware;
"Neighbors," a Kechai, and "Yellow Wolf," a Tonchue;
"John," a Kiowa, and "John Socie," a Cherokee. These men
were faithful to us throughout, and only left the command when
discharged by order from the government. They were certainly
devoted to us, and were ever ready to take their part in the
hardships of the campaign, and endure all the privations incident
to it. But these Indians were exceptions to the general
rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><i>CHAPTER X.</i></h2>

<div class="center">COL. JOHNSTON'S COMANCHE CAMPAIGN&mdash;A GREAT FAILURE&mdash;FRIGHTFUL
SUFFERING OF THE RANGERS.</div>


<p>Not deterred by the desertion of our allies, Colonel Johnston
determined to set out on the campaign. At first our march was
in the direction of Red river; but when near the source of that
stream we turned in the direction of the head waters of the False
Washita, where we engaged in another hunt for wild horses, which
resulted in the capture of a number of fine ponies&mdash;just what we
most needed, as many of our animals had been worn out by campaigning.
Perhaps, however, ours was not altogether a fair game,
as we fell in with the herd when nearly run down by the Indians;
and hence we had little difficulty in securing our prey.</p>

<p>We saw the savages and horses coming over the prairie at full
speed, but they could not see us; and discovering that there
was but a small party, we formed in a circle, under cover of a
hill, and immediately in front of the horses; and, as the herd
passed, we dashed in between them and their pursuers. At the
first sight of us, the Indians wheeled and fled. For myself, I
noosed a beautiful strawberry roan mare, with a white croup,
covered with black spots; but she was fat, and strong, and snapped
my lariat, carrying away the larger portion of the rope. I
need not here repeat the language I used when she escaped me;
suffice it to say, my reflections were not of the most pleasant
character, and I am afraid I gave vent to words more expressive
than elegant.</p>

<p>During our march, we found an abundance of game as far as
Antelope hills, on the South Canadian river, in the Pan Handle
of Texas; but after crossing the Canadian, we saw no other wild
animals than buffalo; but these were plenty, which indicated
that the predictions of the friendly chief would be falsified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Up to this time, we had done well, and had never lacked for
water, though some of it was not of the best quality; and thus
encouraged, we pushed on, following the Marcy trail to the famous
line of 36° 30', which is the northern boundary of the State
of Texas. On crossing the Canadian, we reached a beautiful
sweet water creek, where we stopped for a day's hunt; and as
buffalo could be seen in every direction, we separated into parties
of six or eight, and started on the chase; and, in a few
hours, we had the ground strewn with dead and dying animals.</p>

<p>After becoming wearied with the sport, we commenced saving
the choicest parts of the meat&mdash;the hump steak, shoulder cuts, and
loins&mdash;which were lashed to our saddles and carried to the
camp. When again at our camp, we stretched ropes like a
clothes lines, and proceeded to cut up our meat in long, thin
strips, and hang it out to dry. This is the universal method
among hunters and Indians, of curing buffalo meat&mdash;no salt being
used. It is exposed to the heat of the sun during the day,
and is taken down in the evening, before the dew falls, and put
in the mess sacks. For three or four days it requires airing,
until the moisture disappears; and in a few days more it may
be opened.</p>

<p>From Sweet Water creek, we crossed over to the valley of the
North Canadian&mdash;a stream which seems to puzzle geographers
immensely. According to some authorities, it is sixty miles
longer, and according to others, as much shorter than it really is.
Its exact source is in the Texas Pan Handle, in longitude 23 deg.
from Washington. It is small, with clear water, and for some
distance down it, there is no timber but cotton wood. As we
approached it, game became scarcer; and, when once across, all
signs of wild animals disappeared. For days, we could not
see a crow, or even one of those little brown birds, so plentiful
in every prairie region.</p>

<p>We had intended to go from the North Canadian to the Salt
fork of the Arkansas, but missed our reckoning and struck
the Red fork. It was a long, and wearisome march, and we all
suffered severely from thirst, and many of the men from hunger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
On the Red fork, we divided up our little stores equally, and
turned up Hard Wood creek, heading directly for Santa Fe.
During this march, we suffered greatly from hunger. The stream
on which we were is a famous resort for Kiowas, but they had
all left it, and gone to a section where game was to be had.
All along its banks, there were evidences that but a short time
before, there had been a great number of them camped in the vicinity.
This is a most singular stream&mdash;but eight feet wide,
and dry as a floor at its mouth; while three miles up it was
fourteen feet wide, with a current of clear, swift running water;
and three miles further toward its source, it was the same width,
and two feet deep; and after traveling five days more, in the direction
of its head waters, it measured thirty yards in width,
and was, at least twenty feet deep; and it was yet another day's
journey to its head; but whether or not it increased in size all
the way, I can not tell.</p>

<p>We were all out of rations when we left Hard Wood creek;
and as to Captain Fitzhugh's company, it had been out since
two days before our arrival at the Red fork of the Arkansas.
After traveling in the direction of Santa Fe for some days, we
found so much Indian sign, that after due deliberation, the officers
determined to return in the direction of Fort Belknap.
The chances of our seeing home looked rather gloomy when we
reflected that we had four hundred miles to travel through a
region we knew to be destitute of game; the most sanguine
reader, I presume, would scarcely venture to say that our prospects
were flattering.</p>

<p>From Hard Wood creek we crossed to the Mesquit, one of the
tributaries of the South Canadian; and here we began to feel
ourselves safe from an attack by a superior force of savages, as
the sign was not plentiful and was very old. On this stream
we encamped in a large grove of most beautiful young cottonwoods,
near which was a bluff thirty feet high, with a projecting
cliff, almost forming a cave. Near the foot of this we found the
skeleton of a man and of a huge bear&mdash;perhaps a grizzly. The
arms of the man had been crushed and the ribs broken; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
near by lay the irons of a rifle with part of the mutilated stock,
and a large bowie knife, of the pattern known as the Arkansas
tooth-pick. Judging from appearances, the man had stood on
the ground and shot the bear on the level of the cliff; and that
the animal, though mortally wounded, had leaped down, and
after a desperate struggle, killed the hunter. How long they
had lain there was a mere matter for conjecture; but, doubtless,
the period might be measured by years. No name was on the
gun or knife, and no memorial remained to tell who the unfortunate
hunter was; but the surgeon, after examining the bones,
pronounced them to belong to a white man.</p>

<p>While on this stream, we had a mule bitten by an enormous
rattle-snake, and none of us knew what to do in the matter.
As soon, however, as we had reached the camp, Shawnee Jack
examined the wound, after which he took a survey of the ground
for some distance, till his eye rested on a particular plant, when
he took out his bowie knife and dug it up by the roots. The
root was a long one, somewhat resembling a small sweet potato,
both as to shape and size; and Jack at once bit off a piece, which
he commenced chewing till he had rendered it plastic; after which
he bound it on the wound, which was a severe one; each fang of
the reptile having cut a slit in the hide of the animal, at least
five inches long; and a single night, under the influence of this
wonderful restorative, sufficed to render the animal entirely
sound again.</p>

<p>We were now suffering terribly from hunger; and in every
direction our eyes were searching for something to satisfy our
craving appetites; but we saw nothing till we reached the South
Canadian river, at the mouth of Mesquit creek. There we came
upon a group of low, sandy hills, covered with grape vines,&mdash;no
other vegetation, however, not even grass being in sight&mdash;young
and thrifty, and loaded with fruit&mdash;the first of the kind I ever
saw. This was indeed a God-send to us; the children of Israel
never devoured manna more greedily than we did these grapes;
and having satisfied our appetites, we carried away as many as
we could put in our haversacks and camp kettles. How these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
vines happened to grow there is a mystery; and why they were
so unusually thrifty, considering the soil, is a problem I despair
of solving.</p>

<p>Crossing to the South side of the Canadian, we passed over
Dry river, which appeared to be the only stream in the country
which afforded any water. On the banks of this river we found
a small growth of mesquit and hackberry bushes; and so famished
were a portion of the command, that they actually devoured the
dry mesquit beans,&mdash;which at that time of the year are as hard
as hickory wood&mdash;with greediness. Of those who were ravenous
enough to eat them, I was one. From the valley of Dry river,
we crossed a plain to a stream called White Fish creek, though
why so called I am unable to divine, as I do not think there ever
was a member of the finny tribe within its waters&mdash;if, indeed, it
ever had water in it. When we saw it, at least, it was perfectly
dry, the bottom being covered with a fine white sand.</p>

<p>On the banks of this creek, we found hack berries and Cheatham
berries, of which the rangers partook liberally; but as the
latter were not fit to eat, many of the men sickened. On the
plain were occasional groups of prickly pears, and on some days
we had all we could eat of them; but at other times, they were
not to be had, and we were compelled to do entirely without
nourishment. Continuing along White Fish creek, we at length
reached Prairie-Dog fork of Red river.</p>

<p>All along down the creek, I rode on the extreme right of the
flankers; my companion on the left, being John Socie, a Cherokee
Indian. I had frequently during the day, seen bands of
savages watching us, and had notified the Colonel of it, through
my Cherokee friend, who acted as messenger; and when we
encamped for the night, I repeated to that officer what I had
observed during the day; and also my suspicions that I had
seen an Indian camp, though concerning this I was not willing
to make a positive statement. The Colonel affected to doubt
it, and roundly asserted that there was not a savage within
fifty miles of us. I, however, persisted, and told him to prepare
for a fight on that, or the following night; but he offered to bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
we would not see an Indian between White Fish creek and
and Fort Belknap, and there the controversy ended.</p>

<p>By this time, the men had become perfectly careless regarding
everything, save the procuring of subsistence; utterly disregarding
all the usual precepts taken under ordinary circumstances,
during a campaign. Had the Indians attacked us almost any
day, with a moderate force, we must have been exterminated;
and it is therefore fortunate for us, that they were ignorant of
our actual condition. We encamped that night on the north side
of the river, on the opposite bank of which was a bluff at least
sixty feet high, and fairly sparkling with isinglass. I took a
field telescope, and went over on the bluff, to have a view of
the sandy country, and particularly that laying to the westward;
for it was in that direction, that I believed I had seen the Indian
camp, to which I have adverted. It was a long and tiresome
walk; and about half way up the mountain I reached a level
bench, or steppe, where I found about five hundred small brush
shelters, used by a large party of warriors. So recently had
they been erected, that the leaves were not yet withered; indeed,
they were so fresh, that they appeared to have been cut
on that very day. This sign at once aroused me, and admonished
me to look out for stragglers; but I saw none.</p>

<p>It was just sunset, when I reached the desired point, and from
it I had good a view of the regions around me. The last rays
of the sun lit up the country splendidly, in the direction I believed
the Indians to be; and on arranging my glasses, the
whole of a large village lay in full view. Near them, and grazing,
was a large number of horses, with some cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>The camp was at the base of a mountain, and very extensive&mdash;a
careful estimate placing the number of men, women and children,
at fifteen hundred or more. This discovery did not appear
much to improve the desperate position in which we found
ourselves; and hastening back, I reported what I had seen to
the Colonel, who could now no longer doubt the presence of the
savages. In obedience to his orders, we did all in our power to
make ourselves as safe as possible, and laid down to sleep, fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
expecting an attack before morning; but fortunately none
came, and as we had nothing to eat, and consequently no cooking,
we mounted, and were off at daylight, following the bed of
the stream for about twelve miles, where we found a sweet
water spring, at which we halted to rest ourselves, and refresh
our horses. That night we killed an old buffalo&mdash;so old and
poor that it was with difficulty he could manage to walk;
and he was the first specimen of game we had seen in a week.
Bad as was his meat, we relished it as a luxury; and after eating
what we wanted, laid down to sleep, entirely content to
take whatever might come. There is a wide difference between
a famished man, and one with a full stomach. We put out
guards; but what did they care, now that they had plenty of
meat, and palatable water? what else did they desire? sleep
alone, and&mdash;they slept.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the night wore away without anything
to disturb its quiet; at about two hours before daylight, and
just before the moon went down, Pete Ross was aroused by
the clattering of horses' hoofs. Ross sprang to his feet, and
awakened his men, just in time to get the first shot. As for the
other companies&mdash;they needed not to be awakened by their
officers; the wild, piercing war whoop sounded in their ears, and
each man in an instant had his hand upon his trusty rifle.
There was no mistaking the shout&mdash;it was the war whoop of the
wild Comanche; and no sooner had its echo died away in the
distance, than the whole body of warriors charged down upon
our horses, and stampeded them; and but for the presence of
mind of a few of the rangers, all of them must have escaped.
However, about twenty of the men ran in among them, and by
constant firing, got up a counter fright, and saved about half
our animals.</p>

<p>The savages, having thus obtained possession of a part of our
horses, rode away in triumph. Capt. Fitzhugh at once gave
orders to his men to mount, and pursue; but before he was off,
another party of Comanches raised a demoniac yell, and came
down upon us; but discovering that we were prepared to receive
them, they retired out of gun shot range; but they kept
up such a noise, during the balance of the night, that further
sleep was impossible, and we stood by our arms till daylight, by
which time the last savage had disappeared.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> first party numbered about sixty, and were splendidly
mounted&mdash;some of them on fine American horses of great size;
the second gang chiefly riding ponies. They were armed with
rifles, bows, lances and pistols, which they used promiscuously&mdash;some
being busily engaged shooting arrows, though at the same
time they had six-shooters dangling to their wrists and fastened
by a string. They were for the most part naked, except that
they wore breech clouts, though some sported leggins, and all
had head dresses and moccasins. A few only were in full dress.
The Comanche people wore the buffalo scalp, while most of
the stampede party sported Kiowa feather caps, some of which
fell into our hands. They were very nicely made of long white
plumes, like swan feathers, and beautifully colored at the tips
with red, yellow and black. The quill part is sowed to a close
fitting skull cap made of buckskin, and they are set so close
together that when it is drawn over the head the plumes stand
out in every direction, giving to the wearer a terribly hideous
appearance. The buffalo scalp is worn with horns, and it is so
arranged that these protrude from the top of the head, they
being scraped so thin that they are very light. The skin of the
nose is cut off above the eyes, while that of the neck and hump
hangs down the back, the whole being softly dressed with the
hair on; and as an additional ornament it is often artistically
beaded. The faces of the savages were painted in the
most hideous style; black, red, yellow and white being the
prevailing colors.</p>

<p>Part of the time our struggle was a hand to hand fight, and
the savages succeeded in carrying off seven of our men, and
all their own killed and wounded; so that it was impossible for
us to ascertain their loss, though it must have been severe,
notwithstanding it was a night struggle and the moon was low.
We judged from appearance that there were about seven hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Indians altogether, and this was perhaps rather below than
above the truth.</p>

<p>Our loss in the fight was seven men, forty-six horses, and
seven pack mules. It would have been useless for us to have
attempted to follow up the savages in the dark as soon as the
fight had closed, and by morning the marauders were far away;
and long before we could overtake them, we knew we would be
surrounded, and "wiped out" by superior numbers. Nevertheless,
the Colonel did reconnoiter for some ten miles, but
learned nothing, except that was an unhealthy locality for
Texas Rangers.</p>

<p>We now destroyed all our baggage and cooking utensils&mdash;everything
save what was absolutely necessary to preserve life,
and started for Belknap. Tents, saddles, pack saddles, everything
that would burn was committed to the flames; while kettles,
plates and pans were broken, and our axes buried in the quicksand.
As many of our men were now without horses, we were
compelled to adapt ourselves to circumstances. By the order
of march, the footmen moved first, and then the cavalry close
upon them; and in this manner we made our way across an
immense plain, which seemed to be one solid city of prairie
dogs. A few of these animals were killed and eaten; but our
ammunition was nearly exhausted, and consequently no shot
was fired, unless under the most pressing circumstances.</p>

<p>This section was almost entirely destitute of water, and we
suffered intensely from thirst. Indeed the whole plain was one
broad, barren waste; and over it at least one hundred miles of
our journey lay. The sufferings of the men were so great, that
on the second day after the disaster, the command was threatened
with open mutiny, the soldiers demanding to be allowed to
scatter; and it required all the address of the officers to prevent
them from dispersing over the plain in search of water and
food. Major Fitzhugh threw himself down and begged that
some one would shoot him and thus put an end to his misery;
while Captain Wood sank down exhausted, and urged us to go
on and leave him to his fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>How different the conduct of men when in like trying circumstances!
Major Fitzhugh gave way to despair, while his
brother Gabriel, suffering equally, only increased in resolution
as difficulties thickened around us. Captain Wood was a large
muscular man, yet he sank down, while others of far more
slender mould marched onward with resolute and rapid step.</p>

<p>We had not gone far out on the plain before we discovered
that we would be unable to traverse it for lack of water; and
we were once more compelled to seek the banks of Red river.
Here water would be plenty, but the route over which we were
to travel was covered for miles with sharp, flinty rocks, and
pieces of isinglass, and in addition was extremely hilly; and our
feet would suffer fearfully from the travel on the stones and
sand, while our eyes were inflamed by the reflected rays of the
sun. But we had no choice; we could not die from thirst.</p>

<p>Before we had reached the river, I was almost famished for
water; and coming upon a bluff of saltrock, at least nine feet
thick, beneath which was a sort of cavern, filled with cold brine,
I plunged into it, clothes and all, and was enjoying a bath, when
Colonel Johnston rode up to me and directed me to go in a
southerly direction till I found water, and then to fire a signal
gun; and as a companion I had John Socie, the trusty Cherokee,
with a horse and several canteens, to bring back water to
the famished men. About seven miles from where I left the
Colonel, I came to a creek on the south side of Red river; and
when I reached it, my thirst was raging to such a degree that I
jumped into the water, drinking my fill, and then rolled in the
cooling wave with as perfect an enjoyment as physical pleasure
can afford. After I had taken time to collect myself, I discovered
that I had been drinking bitter water; but hoping that further
out into the stream it would be better, I waded in, but
found that there it was salt. This was discouraging; but on remembering
the condition of my companions, and the necessity
of relief, I started to swim over the stream, hoping to find a
spring on the other side. As I proceeded, I continued to taste
the water for the double purpose of ascertaining its quality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of cooling my parched tongue; and, to my surprise and gratification,
when I reached the middle of the creek, I found that it
was sweet. Instantly I returned to the shore and commenced
firing my gun, as a signal for the exhausted command to make
one more effort to rally. I discharged my piece a number of
times and, at length, had the satisfaction of hearing three shots
in reply, and I knew that the Colonel had heard me; and feeling
assured that the command would come up as rapidly as possible,
I commenced exploring the stream to find out where the
sweet water came from, and discovered that it flowed from a
spring, a mile and a half above. Here we again discharged our
pieces, and again received a reply, but it was a great way off.</p>

<p>I at once filled all the canteens with us, and sent John back
on his horse, to relieve the command; and on his arrival, the
precious treasure was distributed sparingly among those who
suffered most, or sent back to those who had fallen out exhausted,
on the trail. As I had nothing to do during John's
absence, I laid down and took a sound nap; and was only
awakened by the sound of hoofs, when he returned to the spring,
which he did as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>From him I learned that during the morning an open mutiny
had occurred in camp; and that it would have proved successful
but for the eloquent words of Lieutenant Colonel Smith,
who appealed to the men not to abandon their companions who
were unable to travel, but stand by them till we reached another
watering place, when they could once more be refreshed; and
the mules and horses could be sent after those who had fallen
out. This appeal, touching as it was, however, was but partially
successful, till the sound of my signal gun re-inspired all as if
by magic; and they set out with renewed hope, if not with increased
vigor. Some of those who had thrown themselves down
in despair, at once aroused themselves from their lethargy,
and stepped off at a lively gait in the direction of the crystal
treasure.</p>

<p>Fully convinced that they could not now miss the spring, the
Indian and myself started out on a hunt. We were both much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
refreshed by water and rest; and we stepped off at a lively
pace, and after wandering about for some time, we espied a deer
grazing, or, rather, licking salt. It was in the midst of an open
prairie, so that it would be difficult to approach it. But, stealing
around a little to the leeward, we kept our eyes fixed steadily
upon it, and advanced rapidly, with long and hasty strides,
till it gave indications that it suspected the presence of an enemy,
when we halted, standing upright, and rigidly still. After
gazing around for a moment, the animal appeared to dismiss its
apprehensions, and put down its head again and commenced
licking the salt. Once more we began advancing, till we were
almost within range, when it gave its tail a nervous twitch, causing
us to stop again. It viewed us for a moment, but manifested
no alarm, and again resumed its former position. On we glided,
and this time we got within a short gunshot range, and Socie
discharged his piece at the deer, which bounded up in the air,
and then starting ran almost directly toward us, until I had
time to give it another rifle ball accompanied by three buckshot,
which brought it down. We now discovered that John's bullet
had passed through its lungs, and that it had been mortally
wounded, though it might have given us a long chase but for the
contents of my piece.</p>

<p>We now sat down to rest and get cool after our long tramp,
and to devise means to get our prize to camp. The animal was
a large, fat doe, and would weigh at least an hundred pounds.
As I was the stronger man, I proposed to John that he should
carry my gun and pistols, and I would carry the deer. He had
suggested that we leave half of it; but this I refused to do,
when I recollected the condition of our men; so he acceded to
my proposition, and helped me to shoulder the deer.</p>

<p>At the spring, we found all the men assembled who were able
to walk; and, in the distance, we observed the pack-mules coming
in with the stragglers. I never before saw any one enjoy
anything so intensely as did these men the prospect of a dish
of venison. The sight of the dead carcass called out the wildest
expressions of joy from the famished rangers; and not many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
minutes elapsed, before the skin was off, and I was called upon
to divide the flesh. Each man was allowed a small slice: the
largest and best being reserved for those who were most nearly
famished. Many a tear of joy was shed over these scanty morsels;
and more than one rough, stalwart ranger rushed forward
to embrace me, and overwhelm me with heartfelt thanks; and
not a few poured forth praise to Heaven for our deliverance.</p>

<p>We did not leave the place that day; and while sleeping that
night, the Indians made another attack upon us; but no one received
injury, nor were any of our animals stolen. The savages
were readily driven off, and we saw them no more.</p>

<p>Being now comparatively reinvigorated, we again attempted
to cross the plain which had baffled us before. Following this
creek to its source, we came to an immense prairie dog town,
where not a leaf of grass or growing thing was to be seen&mdash;all
having been devoured by the buffalo. While exploring the
creek, we discovered whence arose the varieties of water within
it. The shores were of gypsum, imparting to it a bitter taste
near the edge; on its banks was a salt bluff, which rendered it
brackish, as the water washed around it; while on the left bank
the sweet spring poured out a swift stream, which, on account
of the peculiar shape of the bend, kept out in the middle of the
creek.</p>

<p>We were three days crossing the plain, and our only subsistence
was a few prickly pears of stinted growth. When one of
these plants was found, the ravenous appetites of the men
would not even permit them to scrape off the thorns with which
they are covered; but all was devoured together. Many of
them suffered severely from this cause; the lips and tongue being
penetrated, causing them to swell badly, and be extremely
painful.</p>

<p>After three days weary marching and on the morning of the
fourth, we suddenly came upon the verge of the desert, and but
a short distance was traveled before we were in the midst of one
of the most fertile and luxuriant spots in the State. Grass was
high, and as we soon found a ravine in which water was plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
we hitched our horses to graze for a couple of hours. The animals
being greatly refreshed, we pushed on, and had only gone
a short distance when we came suddenly upon an immense herd
of buffalo. We at once dismounted, and made all the necessary
preparations for a grand "still hunt." Our preliminaries were
arranged under cover; the regiment being divided off into two
parties, one of which was under command of the Colonel himself,
the direction of the other being left to the Indians who
were with us.</p>

<p>The Colonel's party kept in the low ground, while the other
filed down a ridge in full view of the herd, but on the windward
side; and in this manner we advanced, till nearly within gun
shot of the animals. Suddenly we wheeled to the right, down
into a deep ravine, and stooping low, crawled four or five
hundred yards, and were almost in the midst of them, when, at
a given signal, each man marked his meat and brought it down.
After the first discharge, the herd commenced a precipitate
flight; but the men, determined to fast no more, drew their revolvers
and continued firing till the herd had escaped beyond
range. Twenty odd of the buffalo were shot dead in their
tracks, and many more wounded. We were, however, not after
sport, but meat; and leaving those which were crippled to do
as best they could, we fell to cutting up the dead, and devouring
their flesh raw.</p>

<p>Three or four of us rushed upon one cow, and began cutting
out pieces of meat from as many different parts of the body,
although the animal was not yet dead, but struggling violently.
Capt. Wood sliced out one hump steak, Shawnee Jack cutting
out the other; while Neighbors ran his knife into that delicious
piece of half fat, half lean, that lies behind the shoulder blade,
just under the back part of the hump. For my part, I knew
that that meat would require cooking, and I was too ravenous
to await so slow a process, and as I looked upon buffalo tallow
as a dainty, I plunged my bowie knife into her side, and thrusting
my arm through the whole, wound my fingers into the caul
fat, and tore it out and ate it while it was yet warm. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
aware the reader will decide that this was barbarous; but let it
be borne in mind, that we were famishing. So hungry was I,
that this huge flake of fat, dripping with blood, seemed like the
sweetest morsel I ever tasted.</p>

<p>Our hunger slightly appeased, we returned to the ravine in
which the water was so plentiful, staked our horses to graze,
and at once commenced gathering in our meat, cooking, and
eating all the time, till our appetites were entirely satisfied.
One thing that marred the delicacy of the meat, was the fact
that we were without salt. While crossing the desert, mountains
of the article reared their heads around us, but we were
without meat; now meat lay in profusion about us, but we
were without salt.</p>

<p>Ourselves and horses rested, we resumed our march, and after
traveling about five miles, reached the Big Washita river. Here
we halted, for a rest of five days, which we spent in hunting.
We had jerked meat for bread, and fresh meat for beef; feasted
continually on elk, deer, antelope, and wild turkey. During
these five days of carousal, the sufferings on the desert were
forgotten; and at the end of that time, fully restored to our
wonted vigor, we resumed our march.</p>

<p>The direct route would have taken us across another desert; but
we had had experience enough on them, and we therefore determined
to follow the watercourses, though they were ever so
circuitious. We accordingly kept down the Big Washita, till
we reached the point where the Belknap and Radziminski roads
cross, when we left it, and started direct for our place of destination,
distant seventy-five miles. Our route lay through a
good country, with plenty of game, and we fared, like the rich
man&mdash;sumptously every day&mdash;but only on meat; and therefore
the reader may imagine our joy, on reaching the Little
Washita, at meeting a wagon loaded with flour and bacon, with
two ovens and two skillets. What visions of bread once more
arose before us! and how soon we were at work, kneading the
dough! Our readers who are initiated into the mysteries of
cooking, may form some idea of the bread we made, under all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the disadvantages that surrounded us; but it was bread, and
was a feast to us. Weeks had intervened since we had tasted
aught but flesh; and now we baked and ate, and ate and baked,
till all were fit subjects for the hospital, and some came near finding
the graveyard. Orders to march next day, found not a
man free from colic, or dysentery; though a few were able to
travel, and they traveled. Every mile or so, a man would
drop out; and when we reached the end of our day's journey,
of twenty-five miles, there were but few men with us; yet the
stragglers finally all came in and reported, though it is wonderful
that some did not die by the wayside.</p>

<p>The next day was one long to be remembered by every ranger,
as it was the last of that ill-started campaign. Dirty, ragged,
long haired, unshaven, and generally barefooted, we reached
Belknap on the 30th of October, 1860; and immediately we
were mustered out, and paid in scrip, which is now worth less
than nothing; but which, had not the state gone into rebellion,
would have ultimately secured us fifty-two dollars a month in
gold.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE&mdash;SECESSION.</div>


<p>Having been honorably discharged, the rangers began to scatter
to their homes. Many had friends in the vicinity, who came
after them with wagons; refusing to let them ride their war ponies,
but leading these home in triumph, decked with flowers and
ribbons. Parting among the men, rough as they were, gave
rise to many affecting scenes. Hardy warriors wept like children,
as they separated from the companions of their hardships
and dangers. Truly, it might have been said of us that we
were a band of brothers then; but how soon&mdash;such is human
nature&mdash;to become deadly enemies!</p>

<p>I had enlisted at Waco, two hundred miles away, and had no
means of reaching that place except on foot; and learning this,
Colonel Smith tendered me a horse, but he was wild, having
only been caught that spring, when we made our hunt up the
Canadian. He was remarkably fleet on foot when in the wild
herd; no less than sixty horses having been run after him&mdash;first
all at a dash. In the race we had roped all the mares, when
he came back to fight us, trying first to drive the mares, and
then the men, away. Failing in both of these purposes, he
dashed around and around in a circle, always eluding the rope,
though thrown by our best horsemen; and in this way, he baffled
us till our own horses were worn out; when, finally, an Indian,
named Bob, shot him just between the last two short ribs,
and let the ball range forward into the stomach&mdash;a process
known among the savages as "creasing," and is frequently employed
with success; and it is a far safer way than shooting
them in the neck, as is sometimes done. Nevertheless, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
barbarous proceeding, and could only be adopted by those devoid
of every quality of mercy.</p>

<p>Such was the animal tendered me, and the reader will not be
at a loss to conjecture that riding it was not the most pleasant
thing in the world. It had thoroughly recovered from the gunshot
wound, and was well nigh as wild as when first seen on the
prairie; and was, withal, the most vicious beast I ever mounted,
when we set out; but, strange as it may seem, by the time we
reached our journey's end it was completely subdued, both to
ride and work in harness&mdash;was as docile as it had been wild.</p>

<p>Soon after we arrived at Belknap, during the spring of 1860,
a man visited us, who introduced himself as Captain Davis;
but how he obtained the title was, and is, a mystery. He informed
us that he was a member of the Knights of the Golden
Circle, and that he was fully authorized to receive and initiate
men into the order, from his superiors; and that when fully initiated,
the mysteries and objects of the institution would be
explained; that some of the objects must now be kept secret; but
there was one that he could reveal; it was the intention to raise
a force of twelve thousand men to invade Mexico, under command
of General Sam. Houston, the then Governor of Texas;
and that they were to be paid by English capitalists at the rate
of eighteen dollars per month; and that, after the conquest, the
States of Nueva Leon, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas
were to be annexed to the United States; that Gen. Houston was
not taking any public part in the matter, for State reasons; but
that, in a short time, he would throw off all concealment, and
declare his purpose to the world. British subjects, Captain
Davis declared, were to pay the General a fabulous sum for
accomplishing the work, and then settle an annuity upon his
wife. He said that though all the details had not yet been arranged,
they were being rapidly consummated.</p>

<p>He explained to us that the Knights were organized with three
degrees&mdash;the military, the financial, and the legislative. The
first of these was intended to be popular&mdash;to catch the masses
of the people; and as men should not be made to pay too extravagantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for the privilege of serving some one else, the initiation
fee to this degree was but one dollar. To get into the
financial&mdash;ominous name&mdash;more money was required, and the
initiation fee was put at five dollars. To become a third, or
legislative-degree member, influence, and not money, was requisite.
A man odious to the Knights could not have bought a
seat in it; an influential politician could have obtained one at a
mere nominal price&mdash;perhaps for nothing. Members of the first
degree were not allowed to know what was done in the second:
and those of the second were kept in ignorance of the transactions
in the third; and as every one was sworn to do the bidding
of his superior, and each degree to obey the directions of those
above it, the despotism was complete. It was the province of
the few to command; of the masses to obey.</p>

<p>This was the feature to which I objected. I was rather
pleased with some things&mdash;particularly the prospect of adventure;
but I could never take an oath to do an act the nature
of which I knew nothing; nor could I swear to obey irresponsible
men, who proposed to do anything unlawful. If the object
was legitimate, it occurred to me, why this secrecy? and,
I believe subsequent events have proven that my objections were
well taken; indeed, a few months sufficed to satisfy me upon
that subject, and, I think, to satisfy all the world.</p>

<p>The captain was a ready talker, and well calculated to seduce
the unwary into his schemes; and nearly all the rangers were
induced to become members of the order, after which he left to
enlighten the people of other sections. He was exceedingly
lavish in his promises; to become a knight was to secure perpetual
fame at once; and few of the rangers who joined but believed
that the lowest position which would fall to their lot would be
that of a field officer. "All promotions," he said, "were to be
made from the ranks;" (an old story, every soldier knows), and
all the great estates in Mexico were to be confiscated to secure
fortunes to the adventurers. Immense tracts of land were to be
granted to members of the order; the mines in Sonora were to
be parceled out, and every possessor to be made a Cr&oelig;sus at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
once; and a hundred other glittering promises were made, which,
under any ordinary circumstances, would have excited men of a
wild, roving disposition; but in this case, success in obtaining
enlistments was chiefly the result of other causes.</p>

<p>Mexican depredations on the Rio Grande had been frequent;
and many a ranger was longing to retaliate upon the perfidious
perpetrators in Tamaulipas and Nueva Leon; and they looked
upon this as an excellent opportunity to join in a scheme which
promised them revenge&mdash;far sweeter to the pioneer of western
Texas than the wealth of an Astor or a Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>But very soon the attention of the Texans was turned to other
enterprises than the invasion of Mexico, and the Knights had
other foes than Spanish mongrels to fight. When I reached
Waco, the most intense political excitement I ever witnessed
was prevailing. Mr. Lincoln had just been elected president,
and orators were busy on every street corner "firing the southern
heart," which they fully succeeded in doing, though it has
since pretty completely burned out.</p>

<p>I heard nothing now, but clamor about "Northern aggression,"
and "Southern rights," wherever I went. The State should
secede at once; the politicians willed it, and the Governor must
obey. The cry was "secede, secede!" break up all connection
with the Federal Union, by fair means or by foul&mdash;only secede.
Of course I was at once questioned as to my views, and supposing
there would be freedom of expression, I spoke my mind
without reservation; but they did not look upon the matter in
that light, and they plainly intimated that I could choose between
conversion to the views of the secessionists and exile. I, however,
refused to be converted, and was at once denounced as a
tory, a Lincolnite, and an abolitionist; and it was confidently
expected that these epithets would enlighten my obtuse intellect
and arouse my <i>patriotism</i>? This procedure was persisted in
from the time I was mustered out, in November, 1860, till after
the first battle of Bull Run, in July, 1861, when I left the State;
and that, too, in the face of the fact that the greater part of this
time was consumed in protecting the homes and fire-sides of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
maligners from the depredations of the wild Comanches. It may
be chivalry thus to avail one's self of services so onerous and
dangerous, and then vilify him who accomplished them; but it
does not agree with my idea of the meaning of that term.</p>

<p>For a time Gov. Houston resisted the wild fanaticism which
prevailed; but the current was too strong; reason was hushed;
force and fraud were the order of the day; and chivalry and mob
violence ruled the hour and defied the law. A convention was
called and candidates were out early, "defining their positions,"
and soliciting the suffrages of the people.</p>

<p>In McClennan county, where I resided, the candidate of the
secessionists was an ambitious and unscrupulous lawyer, named
Coke, while the Unionists supported Lewis Moore, an old and
highly respected citizen; public spirited and unselfish, and only
interested in developing the resources of the State and nation.
He had taken a prominent part in the Texan revolution, and in
all the border wars, and in the Moderator and Regulator struggle
in 1836-8. Election day came, and Coke received 196
votes, to 94 for Moore&mdash;an exceedingly light poll&mdash;but only light
because no man ventured to tender his ballot without being prepared
to defend it with the pistol and bowie knife. I went to
the polls unarmed; but I soon found that I was alone in this
respect; but I ventured up and tendered my vote. A Mr. Wm.
Chamberlain was receiving the tickets, and a Major Downing was
acting as judge; and when the former observed that my ballot
contained the name of Lewis Moore, his countenance darkened,
and he asked me how I came to tender my vote there.</p>

<p>"You have not been in this country long enough, sir," said
he.</p>

<p>"I have, sir," was my reply, but it was made in a quiet tone,
and entirely different from that in which he addressed me.</p>

<p>"But you have been constantly away, running around after
the Indians," he continued; "how is it you wish to vote here?"</p>

<p>"Because," was my response, "I am registered in the service
for this place."</p>

<p>"But you can't be allowed to vote, sir," he persisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>I began at once to explain my view of the law; that I was a
ranger, and had served the people, and felt that I had a right to
vote at any polls in the State, when he stopped me, saying:</p>

<p>"It is useless to multiply words; you can't vote."</p>

<p>I then left the court-house, went to the hotel, and got my
pistols&mdash;a splendid pair of navy revolvers, and returned immediately;
and seeing my movements, a number of Union men followed
me, crowding the room in which the election was held.
Nearly all of them were old, gray haired veterans, who had devoted
their lives to the service of the State, and were as incorruptible
patriots as ever trod on American soil.</p>

<p>Laying my ballot on the table, I addressed Mr. Chamberlin
with:</p>

<p>"Sir, I have come to vote."</p>

<p>He looked at me, hesitated a moment, glanced at my hand,
which was on my pistol, and the crowd of Union men around
me, the countenances of every one of whom evinced a fixed determination
the meaning of which he could not mistake, and
then turned to the judges, but said not a word.</p>

<p>"Put that ticket in the box, and record my name," said I,
calmly, but firmly.</p>

<p>He did not need another bidding, but slowly dropped the
ticket in the box, took up his pen, and was about to record my
name, when the Major said:</p>

<p>"The law requires a vote to be sworn in, after it has been
challenged."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said I; "if the law requires it, I will be
sworn."</p>

<p>He then produced a Bible, and holding it out to me, I laid
my left hand on it, and the oath was administered, after which
the book was held up toward my mouth, but I stepped back.</p>

<p>"Do you refuse to kiss the book?" said the judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"For what reason," he continued.</p>

<p>"Because the law does not require it," was my response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Chamberlin then registered my name, and I walked out of the
court-house.</p>

<p>This was not an isolated instance of the persecution of Union
voters. The polls were at length closed, and Coke coolly declared
elected, in spite of the smallness of the vote, though this was one
of the most populous counties in Central Texas; and in defiance of
the fact that a large majority of the people were opposed to
secession. But the malcontents were demonstrative, and had
secretly organized and armed themselves, and had the control
of the polls; and no Union man approached but felt that his
life was jeopardized by the act.</p>

<p>There was a remarkable difference between the appearance of
the two parties. The secessionists were mostly young men, who
were both ambitious and fanatical, and who had been led astray
by artful demagogues, who had "an ax to grind." They were
noisy, and many of them, before the sun had reached its meridian
were drunk. They were chiefly of that class of floaters,
who have no interest at stake, and whose dissolute habits are
the bane of the society in which they flourish. The Unionists,
on the other hand, were generally venerable men who had done
much service during the many wars in which the State had been
involved. They had fought to render Texas independent, and
had given their voice for her annexation to the Union; and they
strenuously resisted a faction which proposed to undo the work
which had cost them so much. They possessed property and
character, and were not to be swayed by every demagogue who
sought preferment and office. Such was the condition of affairs
as far as my observation extended; such, I learned, was the
situation throughout the State on that eventful day.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">TYRANNY AND PERFIDY OF THE SECESSIONISTS.</div>


<p>Soon after it became known that the secessionists had carried
the State at the election, the commanders of the various United
States posts commenced surrendering to the State troops. I
was present at the capitulation of Camp Colorado at the request
of a number of Union men, who desired to obtain accurate information
regarding the nature of the proceeding. The insurgent
forces were under the command of Henry M'Culloch, who,
knowing that I had seen service, pledged me a captain's commission,
if I would join the "Confederate" army; and had I
done so, I have every reason to believe he would have made his
promise good; but I refused his offer firmly.</p>

<p>After I had witnessed the capitulation, I returned to Waco.
The Ordinance of Secession had been passed and referred to the
people, and the whole State was in a blaze of excitement. Arbitrary
arrests, broils, murder, and hanging were the order of
the day; and under the pressure large numbers of the Union
men were giving way, and the secessionists were receiving daily
accessions to their strength. The people were either deceived
into secession, lied into it, or driven into it.</p>

<p>Every species of deception was practiced that the ingenuity
of crafty politicians or a licentious press could invent. The
motives of the Northern people were misrepresented, and Union
men, both North and South, outrageously belied. One week the
secession orators would herald to excited audiences that independence
could be consummated without any war at all; simply
by every man voting a secession ticket and showing to the North
that the South was thoroughly united; they would proclaim that
the North was utterly demoralized and powerless to coerce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
seceding States into obedience; nay, that so divided by contending
factions were the people of that section, that they were not
even capable of preserving their own integrity; that even the
Northern States could not maintain a union among themselves,
much less impose one upon the seceding States.</p>

<p>The next week the cry would be changed, and the Northern
States would be represented as thoroughly united, and more unjust
and defiant than ever they were before; that there were no people
in the North that sympathized with the South, or who were willing
to see that section get justice and equal rights. That every
man in the free States was a practical abolitionist, and nothing
would satisfy their rapacity but the immediate and unconditional
surrender of slavery; and even that might not avail; and that
it was more than likely a concession on that subject would invite
aggression on another. Southern men were appealed to in the
most impassioned language not to submit to these demands or
compromise, but to rouse themselves to view matters of State in
their true light, and to prepare for a contest that was inevitable.
Every proposition of the North was treated with disdain; even
the President was hung in effigy, and treated with every indignity,
simply because he was a Northern man, and was elected
by free State votes, when they well knew that he would be bound
by the same oath to maintain the Constitution that had bound
all the Presidents of Southern birth. The sentiments of known
Union men were willfully misrepresented, and, thus distorted,
heralded to the people, in order to infuriate them against individuals
who professed loyal sentiments. For instance, General
Houston would make a speech in Galveston, and take the most
sincere and unqualified Union ground, and forthwith the fiends
of secession would dispatch garbled extracts of it to every paper
in the State that advocated secession, which, in turn, would give
it, with the comments of its unprincipled editors, to the excited
public. Sometimes they would manufacture and publish speeches
for Houston and other patriots which they never delivered; and
these were scattered broadcast to the mob, representing them as
being at length thoroughly convinced that secession was the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
means by which the Southern people could maintain their liberties
and their institutions.</p>

<p>If he made a Union speech in Austin or Waco, denouncing
the secession leaders, and charging them with seeking to overthrow
the last vestige of personal liberty and constitutional
government, and avowing the most vindictive hostility to all men
professing secession principles, and professing undying devotion
to the Union, at all hazards, no sooner would the words fall
from his lips, than his discourse would be garbled to suit the
cause of secession, and scattered all through the country. On
one occasion, I remember, after forged speeches had been published
over and over, and attributed to Houston, his friends in
Waco wrote a letter and requested him to come out and deliver
another address, and contradict them, but the old patriot answered
despondingly that it was useless; he had tried it, and
as fast as he contradicted one lie, they would publish another,
and he would prefer to keep silent. But why enlarge upon
facts patent to the world? Secession was born in sin and cradled
in iniquity, and no man who is not lost to every feeling of
patriotism, nay, who does not wear within himself the heart of
a fiend, will presume to defend it.</p>

<p>But despite of frauds, despite of lying and forging, the Germans
in the vicinity of San Antonio, and the settlers in the
northern section of the State remained true to the Union; and as
the secessionists had determined to secure uniformity, force was
resorted to, and bayonets supplanted arguments and deception.
The first attempt was upon the Germans, and the headquarters
of the southwestern military district was removed to San Antonio,
and ten or twelve thousand desperadoes were sent thither
to overawe all who remained loyal to the old government; and
this process was found to succeed admirably; for in the presence
of such a force, unarmed, unorganized citizens are usually
constrained to keep silence. The houses of all the settlers were
searched, and when arms were found, they were confiscated;
and a most perfect military despotism was thus established over
a disarmed populace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, it was important to the insurgents that the people of
northern Texas should be subjugated; and the work was intrusted
to the notorious Ben. McCulloch, who made his headquarters
at Dallas, and had at his command some fifteen hundred
men; and this force was soon increased by the arrival of reinforcements,
to ten thousand; and having used his army in coercing
Union citizens into secession, till he was satisfied, he
marched it to Fort Smith, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Outside of the districts patrolled by the armies, the work of
converting Unionists by force was adopted by irresponsible
bodies of citizens. Vigilance committees were organized in
every town and village, and their motto was: "No mercy to
traitors," meaning those who were true to their country and the
old flag. In Waco, one of these committees waited upon several
old and esteemed citizens, giving them their choice, either to
cease their opposition to the rebellion, or leave the country.
They publicly proclaimed their determination to hang every
"Lincolnite" in the country who refused, to use their classic language,
to "dry up," at their bidding; and their threats were
by no means idle ones.</p>

<p>One night they visited a hotel, and seized one of the guests&mdash;a
young man from New York, named Wilkinson&mdash;and in the
dead hours of the night took him to the court-house, and there
tried him before a self-constituted committee; and he only escaped
hanging by three votes, although there were no charges
against him other than that he had asked a man to go with him
to New York, and had demanded of certain merchants that they
should secure the firm, in whose interest he was then acting,
certain debts that they had contracted.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, they arrested Dr. Larnard, son of Major
Larnard, paymaster in the United States' army. He was widely
known as a worthy citizen of McClennan county, and highly respected.
The crime with which he was charged, was that of
allowing his negroes to give a party to the negroes belonging to
some of his neighbors; and his sentence was, that he should not
be allowed to go beyond the limits of the county for a year; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he was admonished that if he did so, the fact would be discovered,
and he would instantly be hung.</p>

<p>The despotism of the secessionists had now become so intolerable,
that Union men were everywhere fleeing from the State,
as the only means of saving their lives. Not desiring to leave
yet, but at the same time anxious to avoid trouble, I shouldered
my gun and mounted my horse, and started for a hunt on the
Pecan bayou and Jim Ned creek. While on my way, I stopped
at Cora, a little town in Comanche county, on the day that the
ordinance of secession was submitted to the people, which was
on the 23d of February, 1861; and while hitching my horse, an
officer came out and proclaimed the polls opened; and immediately
the parties who had been standing around, and numbering
from eight to ten, went up and cast their ballots&mdash;all going for
secession. They were all armed, and at first I supposed they
were rangers but I was mistaken. I walked into the court-house,
and when the men to whom I have referred, had finished casting
their ballots, the clerk turned around and addressed me:</p>

<p>"Do you want to vote, young man?"</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"How do you want to vote?" he next inquired.</p>

<p>"Against secession," I promptly responded.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In Waco."</p>

<p>"Then, why didn't you vote there?"</p>

<p>Without giving me time to answer, one of the armed men
came up and addressed me with,</p>

<p>"You was afraid to vote there, was you?"</p>

<p>"If I was afraid to vote there, I am not afraid to vote here,"
I said, imitating his tone and manner as much as possible.</p>

<p>"How is it that you want to vote here?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"Because I am a ranger, and by law have a right to vote
anywhere at a State election," I answered.</p>

<p>When they found I was in the frontier service, there was no
further parley, and my vote was taken, and my name registered.
But when I started for my horse, I was followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
armed crowd; and as I mounted they seemed inclined to enter
into a conversation. But knowing that any further parley with
them would only result in a collision or a dishonorable retreat,
I put spurs to my horse, and left. As I was going out of the
town I heard a voice shout: "O yes! O yes! the polls of the
election are now closed." The law required that they should be
kept open from 6 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>; but these had not been kept
open more than forty minutes&mdash;perhaps not that long.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>




<h2><i>CHAPTER XIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">OUT IN THE WILDERNESS.</div>


<p>This was the last village I had to pass, and I was soon far
away in the solitudes of the wilderness, where political contests
are unknown. Game was plentiful. Far out on the Jim Ned
creek I found a new settlement, made since my last visit to that
part of the country. It was built by a man named Hunter, who
was a hunter by occupation; and he invited me to make my
home with him while I remained in that section; remarking, at
the same time, that as the Indians were pretty thick, we had
better hunt together; and I accepted his hospitality.</p>

<p>His family consisted of a wife, two daughters, and a son-in-law;
one of the ladies being single. One evening, as I was returning
to the house, after a lonely day's tramp through the
woods, I chanced to meet the younger of the two daughters,
nearly two miles from the house, carrying with her a rifle and a
pistol. She asked me if I had seen her cows, but I regret to
say that I had not. I then asked her if she had any idea how
far she was from home; and she answered correctly, and with
perfect coolness, regardless of the danger from the savages who
continually infested the neighborhood. Nor did she seem in
the least disturbed when I informed her that I had seen at least
a half a dozen that day; but she quietly inquired:</p>

<p>"What sort of a hide is that you've got?"</p>

<p>It was the skin of a panther nine and a half feet long. She
examined it closely, but expressed neither surprise nor fear
when I told her that I had killed it within a quarter of a mile
of the spot where she then stood. I then went with her till she
found her cows, when I drove them home; and frequently,
after that, we went cow hunting together. She always carried
her rifle with her, and could bring down a deer, at a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a hundred yards, as well as a man could do it. She had never
yet been attacked by Indians in her lonely rambles, and if she
had been, more than one would have been required to get off
safely. She had been at a neighbor's house, some time before,
when it was hemmed in by savages, and besieged for several
hours. There were several men in the house to defend it, but
she was the only female, save the wife of the owner of the cabin.
The men were only there by chance; they were hunters, and
being pressed by Indians, took refuge in the house, otherwise
she and the lady owner would have been there alone.</p>

<p>During the attack Miss Hunter moulded bullets for the men,
and rendered every assistance in her power, keeping perfectly
calm and collected all the time, though she full well knew the
terrible doom that awaited her if the savages succeeded in
carrying the house by storm, or in setting it on fire.</p>

<p>We could often kill deer by standing in the door of the old
man's house; and his dogs almost nightly had a row with a catamount,
or some other wild animal which was essaying to carry
off his pigs or chickens from his very door.</p>

<p>I remained with Mr. Hunter several weeks, when having accumulated
all the peltries my horse could carry, I started on my
return to the settlements, after giving the family with which I
had lived so pleasantly an affectionate good bye. I had been
so kindly treated that I was loth to leave, and his wife urged me
now that as I had killed their winter's meat, I ought to remain
and help eat it; but I could not entirely make up my mind to do
so, and we parted.</p>

<p>On the way back to Waco I witnessed a very singular contest.
On reaching the edge of the settlements, I encamped one night
beneath a very large live oak tree, and in the morning, just as I
was getting ready to start, I espied a very large pack of wolves
chasing a young heifer across the prairie. There must have
been nearly a hundred of these animals in the pack, and when I
discovered them she was getting extremely wearied, and, indeed,
nearly exhausted. Near by was a herd of about one hundred
and fifty cattle, of all sizes, beside young calves, and for these
the heifer made direct for the herd, bellowing at every jump. No
sooner did the herd discover her distress than the old cattle commenced
snorting, and soon ran together in a huddle, with their
heads outward, and making a complete circle, enclosing the calves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i150.jpg" width="900" height="540" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"When we got there I was immediately surrounded by about two hundred men, some crying 'Hang him!' 'Shoot him!'
'Shoot the d&mdash;d Yankee!' and several of them leveled their guns on me."&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_241">241</a>.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>The heifer at length reached the flock, and after running
twice around the circle found a position in it, when she at once
assumed a defiant attitude. The wolves followed her till
she reached a place of security; and so many were there
of them that they became scattered into a complete circle,
entirely enclosing the cows. The cattle stood eyeing the intruders
for a time, and then raised a loud snort, and simultaneously
charged upon the wolves and drove them flying over the
prairie for several hundred yards.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the change in the deportment of the
wolves. A few minutes before they were pursuing their victim
at a furious rate, with ears and tails erect, the hair of their necks
on end, tongues lapping for blood, and eyes aglare with rage;
but now they were flying with ears drooping, tails between their
legs, and piteous looks&mdash;a perfect photograph of fright personified.
The wolves were scattered in every direction, and some of
them were still running, though many had taken courage to halt
and reconnoitre, when I concluded to take a hand in the imbroglio,
and therefore commenced shooting at the animals, and
those that were nearest me doubtless felt the effects of my shot,
for several fled to a high hill not far off, while those at a distance
turned around to see what new enemy had presented
himself.</p>

<p>After I fired my pistols off, I very foolishly neglected to
reload them, though I continued howling like a wolf to call them
up so I could fire into them again if I so desired. Before I
was aware of it five very large gray ones bounded up from
behind me, full of fight. I did not want to break my pistols, so
I picked up a large bone that lay at the root of the tree, and
began to fight my assailants with great vigor, believing I could
soon run them off, "but they didn't run worth a cent," but
would stand sideways to me, then springing straight up into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
air and turning their heads around, snap at me. Their jaws
would snap like a steel trap when they closed, and every time I
hit one over the head his eyes would almost blaze with rage.
I struck and kicked them several times, but finding that they
were not disposed to retreat, I thought perhaps it might be
prudent for me to do so, and walking backward, I made for my
pony, and when near enough, mounted with a spring and dashed
off some distance and loaded my pistols. The wolves did not
attempt to pursue nor did I fire at them again; for so large a
pack had they endeavored to do so, might have pulled my horse
down and torn both it and me into fragments, and devoured
us. Another incentive to a retreat was the fact that the smell
of my peltries had already begun to attract their attention, and
even if I did not annoy them by any more firing, I was by no
means safe; and I therefore made the best of my way to Waco.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIV.</i></h2>

<div class="center">FAREWELL TO DIXIE.</div>


<p>When I arrived at Waco I found the wildest excitement every
where prevailing. A large number of Union men had been arrested,
and several hanged. Neither the property nor the life
of the loyal people was safe. A number of men for no other
offense than refusing to openly commit themselves to secession,
were rendered homeless by the torch of the incendiary; and like
the leper, no one would give them shelter. A draft was imperiously
called for, for already it was discovered that however much
the Southern heart was fired, the number of volunteers the exigency
demanded, was not forthcoming. Draft, draft, draft;
every where the word was repeated; nothing would satisfy the
rebels but a resort to conscription; but they knew less of the
unpleasant character of that bitter operation than they did three
years after, or they might have hesitated before demanding a
resort to the wheel of fortune.</p>

<p>Soon after my return, a ranger, named Michael Somerville, an
Alabamian, and a friend of mine, quietly informed me that the
vigilance committee had my case under consideration, and had
been discussing the propriety of hanging me, and that the subject
had been broached to the rangers, but it was soon discovered
that I had entirely too many friends to permit them to molest
me seriously. It was then resolved to draft me; and to this my
friends offered no objection. About the last of July, 1861, an
order for a conscription in McClennan county was received at
Waco. The document came in on the mail stage from Austin
about nine o'clock at night, and on the following morning, after
eating an unusually early breakfast, I mounted my pony and was
off for the north.</p>

<p>The first place aimed for was Jefferson, at the head of Soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
lake, a place of some commercial importance; and on reaching
it, I found the excitement there as wild as at Waco. Already
large quantities of stores were being accumulated there, to be
used in the pending campaign, and the streets continually echoed
to the sound of the drum, as company after company of the
Johnnies passed through them. From Jefferson I started to the
north western corner of Louisiana, where the State joins both
Texas and Arkansas. While traveling along one day, I heard
some guns firing a short distance to my left, but supposing
it to be a company of troops discharging a volley at a target, I
paid no attention to the matter. But presently two men rode
hurriedly past, and from what I could gather of their conversation,
I was led to believe that some horrid transaction had just
taken place. Desirous of knowing something of its nature, I
rode rapidly along, and soon overtook the two men and entered
into a conversation with them, and asked them, in a careless
manner, what the firing meant; and in response, one of them
gave me the details of a most horrible murder which had just
been committed. A house stood near the corner of the State, to
which I have already adverted, owned by a prominent Union
man, whose name I can not now give, it having slipped my
memory; and it appears that he had given offense to a Captain
Jolly, who was an aspirant for a commission in the rebel army;
and that as a method of revenging himself, Captain Jolly had
led twenty-four men to the house, and in cold blood, he and his
party shot down and killed four men and wounded two more;
and that they had likewise killed a negro woman. My companions
manifested the utmost abhorrence at the deed, and soon gave
me to understand that they, themselves, were Union men.</p>

<p>As I traveled through Arkansas, I passed myself off as a nephew
of Albert Pike, who was at that time a Brigadier General in the
rebel service; replying, when questioned, that I was going to
Little Rock to see the General, and enter the service. Of course
I had to play the part of a secessionist all this time; had I done
otherwise, my life would have paid the forfeit. But once in Little
Rock, I had played my game out, and I had not the remotest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
idea how I was next to proceed; but knowing that delay was
dangerous, I at once set about contriving a way of escape, and
finally got off.</p>

<p>Near the town of Arkadelphia, I overtook a preacher on the
road, and we immediately entered into a conversation on the
political situation, and I was not long in ascertaining that his
sympathies were with the Union cause; I then told him frankly,
that I was a Union man, and I inquired of him how persons of
that political faith were treated in that region. He appeared
frightened at my frankness; and as we were near the town, he
advised me not to go through it, but take a byway that led
around it, and into my road again some distance beyond the
place. He then stated that at least twenty men had been hung
in that vicinity, for their devotion to the old government.</p>

<p>I politely declined to accept his advice, as to making a circuit
of the town, but told him I would ride through to see the
sights; and on arriving in front of the hotel, I dismounted,
threw myself "around a drink," and then mounted again; but did
not ride off immediately, as I had entered into an interesting
conversation with the clergyman. But I had not been there
long, when I was surrounded by a large crowd of soldiers, who
at once set to questioning me, as to what was the news, where
I was going, where I was from, etc.; and to all of these, my answers
were so different from the tenor of our private conversation,
that the Reverend Gentleman must have pronounced me,
in his mind, as a rival of Baron Munchausen, with a fair prospect
of eclipsing his fame. Nevertheless, he seemed pleased at
the sudden political summersault I had turned, and he doubtless
fully appreciated my motives for becoming so readily a convert
to secession.</p>

<p>While riding along with my clerical friend, I was warned of
a "little log grocery on the hill," where, my informant said,
about a dozen men, mostly strangers, had been set upon and
killed, by secessionists, since the political excitement had commenced.
It was located in a dense, piny woods, and frequented
by the lowest class of men in the country; but this admonition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
instead of rendering me cautious, only excited me, and started
within me a desire to "see the sights;" and I therefore rode
directly up to the grocery, which, on my arrival, contained no
man except the keeper. I at once dismounted, and entered,
determined to see what the place was like. The landlord of the
place was a very clever man&mdash;all grocery keepers are, you
know, on the same principle that the cat is, while you stroke it
the way the fur lays&mdash;and at once entered into a conversation
with me about the state of the country, and <i>our</i> prospects of
whipping the yankees; and of course, according to our figures,
it would be easily accomplished. When he learned that I was
a nephew of Albert Pike, he was glad to see me, and insisted on
my remaining with him, which I did, from the time of my arrival,
at noon, till ten o'clock the next day.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, a party of men collected around the
place to drink, talk politics, and curse the yankees; and of
course I bore my part, and if some of my yankee friends could
have heard me "set them up," they would have been astonished
at my hypocrisy, if not edified by my discourse. At supper,
my new found friend shut up the grocery, and took me home
with him to supper, and I was introduced to his wife and brother,
as a nephew of Albert Pike. His wife prepared for me a
splendid meal, while he took me around and showed me his
place, stock, crops, and niggers, all of which, of course, I admired.
While we were eating supper, his brother came in, and
called him out, and the two stood whispering together for some
time in an excited manner, at the same time, as I thought, casting
suspicious glances at me; after which the elder brother
went away abruptly. What now, I wondered; was there some
scheme on foot against me? They eyed me several times exceedingly
closely; and I asked myself: could there be any suspicion
against me? I had certainly not been indiscreet? then
what could that hurried manner, and those sidelong glances
portend?</p>

<p>I began to think I had been followed from Texas by some
vindictive rebel, who wanted to prevent my going north, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the mystery was suddenly solved, without my being compelled to
ask any questions. The man, whose name was White, informed
me that his brother had just been in to invite us over to a
dance. His daughter was married a few days since, and they
had been dancing ever since. This was the third night, and the
party would break up in the morning. What a weight of anxiety
that declaration, which I saw was made in good faith, removed
from my mind! I tried to beg off, as I needed rest; but it was
of no use; his brother, he said, would accept no refusal; and
without more ado, I went.</p>

<p>We had a walk of about two miles through a gloomy swamp,
when we began to hear the sound of a violin breaking the stillness
of the night; and also the sound of shuffling feet, keeping
time to the music, together with the heavy rattling of a puncheon
floor; and very soon after, we emerged from among the
bushes into a little clearing, where was a large double log-cabin:
with lights streaming out through every crevice; and into this
we entered without ceremony. Forty or fifty stalwart men&mdash;real
sons of the forest&mdash;were there, with checkered coats and
what had been linen standing collars on heavy cotton shirts
with no bosoms; but, alas! exercise in a hot climate in midsummer
generates sweat, and sweat will tell upon standing collars;
and theirs were clinging to the neck like wet rags; they likewise
had on striped home-made pants, and very heavy cowhide
boots.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were truly handsome. I never was much
of a critic of ladies' clothing, and, therefore, I will not here undertake
to describe the outline, except to say that the dresses
were of very costly material, and made after the very latest of
rustic fashion, and each one was highly pleased with her appearance.</p>

<p>On a kitchen table sat a very big, and, certainly, a very black
negro, playing the violin, and calling off, in mellifluous sing-song
tones, tuning his voice to the music of his instrument, perfectly.
There were two cotillions on the floor, whirling and twirling, in
the giddy mazes of the dance, to the voluptuously measured cadence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the "Arkansas Traveler"; (who has not heard it?).
The music is familiar to almost every ear, but, alas! how few
there are who have been so favored by Divine Providence and
propitious circumstances as to have seen the "Arkansas Traveler"
danced by natives to the <i>manor</i> "born"&mdash;no other people
know the <i>manner</i> of its performance, as do the people of Arkansas;
and no other musician can render the piece on the violin
or banjo like a Arkansas plantation darkey. By the side of
the fiddler sat a veteran banjo picker, who added much to the
effect of the music; and, as the fiddler called off the figures of
the dance, this old darkey would recite the dialogue of the Arkansas
Traveler, keeping perfect time to the music. For the
benefit of the reader who has never had the pleasure of seeing
it performed, I will endeavor to convey an idea of it, although
one can give but a faint conception, on paper: the thing must
be seen and heard to be appreciated.</p>

<p>The scene represents a belated traveler in Arkansas, in an
"airly day." I suppose, reader, when your "dad" and mine
were boys, or, perhaps, earlier, he halts before a dilapidated
cabin, to see if he can get to stay all night. It is a miserable
squalid place. The rain is pouring down in torrents, and the
old man of the house is perched on a whisky barrel in the only
dry corner, playing the first part of a tune. The children are
huddled around the fire, peering curiously at the stranger, while
the old woman, with one arm a-kimbo, is stirring a pot of mush
over the fire, holding her dress back between her knees, to keep
it from burning. The roof of the cabin is partly demolished;
a couple of pigs ruminating about on the ground-floor, and
chickens, with dripping feathers, roosting on the timbers over
head. This is the state of affairs when the story opens; the
reader can gather the remainder as the old banjo player recites
it.</p>

<p>"Balance all," shouts the fiddler; when the old banjo picker
starts off with:</p>

<p>"Hello, ole man, kin I get ter stay here all nite, rad di di da
di di da da da."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"I once went into the dungeon where these men were, and found them handcuffed, and chained in pairs by the neck with

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>"First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> and third couple, forward and back," yells the fiddler.</p>

<p>"Yer kin get ter go ter de ole boy, I guess," breaks in the
banjo picker, keeping time with the dancers' feet.</p>

<p>"First lady balance second gemman."</p>

<p>"I say, ole man, whar doe dis road go to, rad di di da di di da
da?"</p>

<p>"Swing," yells the fiddler, and old white head goes on with:</p>

<p>"I ben a livin' here about forty years an' it aint gone no
whar yit, ra di di da di di da da da," etc.</p>

<p>"How far is it to de forks ob de road? rad di di da," etc.</p>

<p>"Ef yer done kep on, yer done ben dar by dis time," then
again chimed in his rad di di da di di da da da.</p>

<p>"I say ole man, is ye gwine ter let me stay all nite? rad di di
da da."</p>

<p>At the next break in the music, he answers:</p>

<p>"Aint got nuffin to eat, stranger, yer better go on ter de nex
house, rad di di da da," etc.</p>

<p>"How far is it, ole man, to de nex house? ra di di da da," etc.</p>

<p>A pause then ensues, when he continues:</p>

<p>"'Bout nineteen miles, I guess, rad di di da," etc.</p>

<p>"Ole man, dats too fur ter ride ter nite in de rain."</p>

<p>He then paused, in order not to speak his part, when the
other called off, but after the call, chimed in again:</p>

<p>"I can't help dat, yer know, rad di di da da."</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, the traveler seems to resolve on
a new course of tactics, and begins with:</p>

<p>"I say, ole man, why don't yer put a new roof on yer house?
rad di di da di di da da."</p>

<p>"Oh, er's a rainen too hard."</p>

<p>"Why don't yer put de roof on when it aint a rainen? rad
di di da," etc.</p>

<p>"Oh, when er don't rain, er don't need it, rad di di da di di
da."</p>

<p>The old fellow keeps on playing, while the traveler again reflects
a moment; one thing is certain, it is raining too hard to
proceed, and he must stop; and a happy idea suggests itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Hitherto the man with the fiddle had only played one part of the
tune, and it seemed to be a favorite air; and the traveler, who
is himself a master violinist and composer, says:</p>

<p>"I say, ole man," (the reader will remember I give it as the
darkey recited it), "why don't yer play de rest ob dat piece?
rad di di da di di da da."</p>

<p>All this time the dance is progressing, and the young folks
"spreading" themselves, and full of glee, at the recitation, while
the violinist almost excels himself.</p>

<p>"Don't know no more; does you know it all? rad di di da."</p>

<p>"Sartinly, I does." Instantly the old man springs from the
whisky barrel, invites the traveler to dismount, orders one of his
own little urchins to put the traveler's horse in the stable, tells
his wife to get supper, assures the traveler that his son will soon
be back from mill; has a chicken taken down and killed for supper,
has a jug of whisky brought in from the smoke-house, and
assures the traveler that they are not so nearly starved out as
he had a moment before supposed; then mounting his guest on
the whisky barrel, gives him the fiddle, and calls for the balance
of the tune, which was played with a gusto, and christened the
"Arkansas Traveler," since so popular among violinists.</p>

<p>The dance was exceedingly amusing. The girls moved very
lightly and with considerable grace; but the men made a tremendous
lumbering over the loose puncheon floor. When it
came to the "balance all," the heeling and toeing of those heavy
boots, was positively horrifying; but the "swing" was rendered
with such a hearty good will, and the girls seemed to enjoy it
so well, that I almost wished I was a dancer myself.</p>

<p>The bride showed us to the supper room, where we found a
table loaded with every luxury which the State could afford. We
did justice to the viands, and then went back to the dance.
The bride was anxious to dance with me; at least her uncle told
me so; and I felt considerably abashed, when I told him I could
not dance. Not to be able to dance, in Arkansas, is as bad as
to be no horseman, in Texas. The bride went through one set
with her uncle, who appeared to be about the best dancer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
house. The girls all seemed to vie with her, which made me
conclude that they wished themselves in her place; while the
lady herself acted and looked as pretty as she knew how.</p>

<p>The fiddler threw all his powers into his playing and his stentorian
voice; and the men heeled and toed with a hearty goodwill,
and the puncheons rattled beneath their measured, swinging
tread. It was a complete and graphic picture of good old fashioned
social life. Indeed, the dancers exerted themselves so
long, and well, that the puncheons seemed to take up their spirit,
and appeared as if endeavoring to extemporize a hornpipe on
their own hook. I had often heard the old story of the man in
Arkansas who gathered up half a bushel of toe nails on his
floor, after a dance; and I was scarcely inclined to doubt its
truth, after what I witnessed on that night.</p>

<p>We enjoyed ourselves hugely, till after twelve o'clock, when
we went back to my friend's house. When I was about to
start, on the following day, he insisted that I should remain
longer with him; but I urged the pressing state of affairs, telling
him that we Southerners must take the field, as quickly as
possible, if we would prevent the country from being overrun
by the Yankee vandals of the North. Excuse me, reader, but
I was talking at a mark then.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Little Rock, I found the town full of soldiers,
who had come in response to the first call of the Governor
for three thousand men; and these were the same troops
who fought at Wilson's Creek, a short time after. While at Little
Rock, I was attacked by bilious fever, and was sick for ten
days. I stopped at a hotel kept by Capt. Lee, who was a violent
secessionist. My story about being a nephew of Albert Pike,
was of great service to me; and I was enabled to keep up appearances,
without being detected, by the fact that he and his
sons were all out in the Indian Nation, recruiting savages for
the rebel service.</p>

<p>When I got well, and was able to leave, I found myself guard
bound. The town was under military law, and every road was
picketed, so that escape was next to impossible. I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
compelled to sell my horse to pay expenses while sick, getting
but fifteen dollars for an animal worth at least one hundred;
and I was walking along the levee a little disconsolate,
when I saw a little steamboat called the William Henry, and I
immediately went on board of her. Looking around, I saw the
carpenter at work on the bow, and I stepped up to him, and inquired
if he wanted any help, telling him I would assist him
down to Napoleon, for my fare. To this proposition he readily
assented; remarking that he always liked to have help when
there was work to do.</p>

<p>While I was talking to him he stuck the foot adze into his foot,
and cut the big toe almost loose from his left foot. The blood
flowed profusely, and I at once set myself to work and bandaged
up the wound, in the presence of the captain and mate, and he
was sent to the hospital immediately. As soon as this was done,
the captain turned to me and said:</p>

<p>"Young man, are you a ship carpenter?"</p>

<p>"They call me one," I replied.</p>

<p>"Do you want to ship?" was his next question.</p>

<p>"Yes, for a while," was my response.</p>

<p>"Then go to work," said he, "and I'll give you fifty-five dollars
a month, and fare in the cabin."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," was my response, "as long as I like the boat;
and I'll tell you how I like it at Napoleon."</p>

<p>He was satisfied, and turned away, while I went on shore for
my outfit. At the tavern, I found no one but a <i>negro clerk</i>, to
whom I paid my bill; and, as he had too much manners to be inquisitive,
I left the house without being reported to the police&mdash;the
hotels being required to report all arrivals and departures
to the military authorities. Once more on the boat, she soon
shoved out, and I began to feel tolerably safe. I found there
would be plenty of work all the time, but as I had never been a
carpenter&mdash;never having worked a stroke on either house or
boat in my life, I was a little afraid I should not be able to sustain
myself in that capacity. "A still tongue makes a wise
head," was my motto then; for I did not know the technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
terms used by carpenters or boatsmen. I did not know even
all the names of the tools furnished me to work with; so it was
manifestly to my interest to preserve silence. I went to work,
however with confidence, and energy; resolved, if they found
out how little I knew, it should be by observation, and not from
anything I might say. The work must have been creditably
done, for I heard the captain boast to the pilot that I was the
best "chip" he ever had. My greatest horror was a recruiting
officer, named Harrison, who come down to see me. He was a
reckless man, a planter, who seemed to care little for money,
and I may add, for anything else. He said he wanted to raise
a company of guerrillas, for the purpose of "carrying the war
into Africa;" and that he wanted young men who were not
afraid to follow him, and that he intended to go right into the
Northern States.</p>

<p>This boast may be a little amusing, but Mr. Harrison was not
the only one who at that time indulged in such hallucinations,
and who entertained such wild hopes. He intended, he said,
when he got into the Northern States, to "go for all that was
in sight, and let the tail go with the hide." I told him he was
just the man to suit me, but I was engaged on the boat, and
could not quit her. His was the sort of service I liked, but I
could not go into it now, at least until the captain could get
another "chip;" but in the event that I enlisted, I would have a
preference for his company; and to make him believe I was serious,
I took his address. He was one of the men who accompanied
Lopez to Cuba, and said he had been in two fights on
that island in an hour and a quarter. He was satisfied to take
my name as I gave it&mdash;Mr. Fitzhugh. He would stand and talk
to me and the other boat hands by the hour, and often puzzled
me by his sudden and almost inexplicable questions.</p>

<p>At Napoleon I sawed out five large hatches in the boat, so
that freight could be stowed very rapidly in the hull; and after
this had been done, the men began to load her throughout with
military stores. The boxes were handled very carelessly, and
would frequently split open, when I would be called upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
nail them up. They were filled with harness of all kinds. Besides
these the boat took on a large quantity of ammunition for
musketry and artillery, and also a full battery of guns, and sixty-five
government wagons; all consigned to Fort Scott, Arkansas,
for the use of Ben McCulloch's army. The next morning a
large boat&mdash;the Mary Kean&mdash;came alongside, and I told the captain
I was too weak to work, and would consequently go up to
Memphis on her. He did not like to have me leave him, but
seeing that I was really not in good health, he offered no objection.
The best of the joke was, I told him I wanted to go into
the service, and that, by confederate law, he dare not dissuade
me from going. On board the Kean I found a great number of
rebel officers, strutting about in new uniforms and gauntlet
gloves, with all the dignity of princes of high degree. I took
one look in the cabin, and that was enough for me; and I instantly
put down on deck, and stowed my humble self away on
a lot of coffeesacks.</p>

<p>The fever had returned on me, and I was suffering terribly.
At Memphis I stopped at the "Woodruff House," a neat little
tavern, kept by a woman named Smith, whose husband was in
the rebel army, and was stationed at that time at Fort Pillow.
At this house I remained sick a week, and when well enough to
go out, I found myself once more guard-bound, with a duller
chance of making my escape than at Little Rock.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to visit all the depots, at each one
of which I found a provost guard stationed, who inspected the
passes of passengers. I made a careless inquiry, and found
that every road leading from the city was picketed. It was at
the time when Tennesseans were moving their troops through
Memphis into Missouri, a great part of which were at Wilson's
creek.</p>

<p>The provost marshal's office was kept by Col. C. H. Morgan,
a man, by the by, who very much resembled the notorious John
H.; and to him I went, telling him that I wanted to go to Bourbon
county, Kentucky, where my parents lived.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "you must bring with you two respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
witnesses, whom I know, to testify that you are a good
Southern man."</p>

<p>I replied that it would be useless to try to do that, as I was
an utter stranger in the city, and that no one knew any more
of me than he did; and he at once informed me that I could not
leave the city. At this I got angry, and told him I would go
without a pass, and he replied that he would have me arrested.
I at once moved for the door, and as he had no guard, he could
not stop me. I told him that I did not think his recommendation
would be of much value to me or any other honest man, and
then made tracks.</p>

<p>This was in the evening, and that night I sold my Mexican
saddle and other equipments, which had belonged to my horse,
so that I was without baggage, except a pair of saddlebags, to
carry; and I resolved at once to get out of Memphis at all
hazards.</p>

<p>Next morning, as I was standing in the door, I saw a great
crowd about the market-house, which was only a short distance
from the tavern; and when I first observed them, they were just
about scattering to go home. There were a great many country
wagons there, which had come with produce; and these were
about to leave the city, and it occurred to me that the opportune
moment for escape had arrived. I hurried off, and paid my bill,
and then walked to the market-house, and hailed a countryman,
asking him to let me ride in his wagon. He did so cheerfully,
and when in I asked to be permitted to drive, to which he
agreed; and taking off my ranger blouse, I threw it in the
wagon, and we drove out. There were provost guards on duty
in the streets, arresting every suspicious person; and there were
pickets at the end of each street, but they did not stop us, as
they evidently supposed we were both farmers; and on we rattled
through two camps of five thousand men each, and finally
reaching a point about six miles from the town, I parted from
my friend, and took the road for Nashville on foot.</p>

<p>At Summerville I was stopped by a crowd of men who were
very anxious to know who I was, where I was from, where I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
going, what I had been doing, and what I was going to do, and
so on; and they also appeared exceedingly anxious to ascertain
my political opinions. Of course I was secesh. I had been
warned before I got to town that I had better go around it, as
no one was allowed to pass through it, unless they were well
known rebels. Nothing daunted, however, I halted in the village,
and sure enough, was overhauled and placed in the hands
of the vigilance committee.</p>

<p>On learning that I had been a ranger, one of them, a Mr.
Reeves, inquired if I knew any man of his name in Texas.</p>

<p>"Calvin Reeves?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; and he is my brother," was the response. He then
asked me a great number of questions, which I answered without
hesitation, and so truthfully, that my account corresponded exactly
with that which Reeves had given himself. We had both
been in Johnston's regiment, and our narratives corresponded
exactly. The examination lasted from twelve o'clock till dark,
after which they professed themselves satisfied that all was right
and released me, telling me that I could go on. But I had not
proceeded more than a hundred yards before I was called back,
and one of them said to me:</p>

<p>"You say you are going home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir;" I replied.</p>

<p>"You live in Paris, Bourbon county, Kentucky?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you intend to fight for the south, do you?" my questioner
persisted.</p>

<p>"I will if I know myself," said I.</p>

<p>"You think you will stick to your principles, when you get
there?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I feel very confident of that," I answered.</p>

<p>"You know," he continued, "that a good many Kentuckians
are a little tender-footed now; they don't like to come out
against the Union, and they don't like to go with the abolitionists;
and I am afraid when you get back there, you will let them
talk you out of your principles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not so easily converted as that comes to," said I, jocularly.</p>

<p>"Well, how is it," he asked, "that you are on foot?"</p>

<p>"Because," was the reply, "I am unable to ride."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said he, "we will help you;" and they accordingly
made up a purse of eight dollars and seventy-five cents
and gave it to me.</p>

<p>"Now," said one, "you go over to the tavern and stay all
night."</p>

<p>I arose to comply, and was thanking them for their kind interest
in my welfare, when a stout looking man, who had sat in
a group of three or four others, apart from the near ones, rose
and remarked:</p>

<p>"Young man, I think you had better go with me; I will give
you accommodations for the night."</p>

<p>He then led the way, and I followed him home, and he gave
me a very good supper, after which I retired at once. All this
time I was wondering what made him take such an interest in
me. After I was in bed, Reeves and a lawyer visited me, who
said they had called to have some further talk about Calvin
Reeves and his doings in Texas; and it was not until I had told
them a second time all my acquaintance and experience with him
that I discovered they were comparing my statement with his.</p>

<p>"Why," I asked, "have you not seen him yet? He left Texas
some time since, to come home."</p>

<p>"O yes," they replied, "he has been at home, but has now
gone off to fight the yankees."</p>

<p>They bowed themselves out about midnight, after having talked
me nearly to sleep several times. The most of the conversation
was about politics, and I excused my ignorance on the different
topics advanced, by telling them I had just got in off the plains,
and was not posted; but taking good care to be just secesh
enough to give confidence, and not strong enough to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>When they had gone, I began to flatter myself that I was done
with them; and that now all were satisfied and I should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
troubled no more. Next morning I met my host at the breakfast
table, and found him dressed for a journey. He then began
a conversation by remarking:</p>

<p>"My name is John D. Stanley; I am sheriff of this county, and
am going down the road with you as far as La Grange. It is
nearly car time now."</p>

<p>He then added that a man had been killed at La Grange, and
he was going down to see about it. We went to the cars together
and occupied the same seat; and on our journey he kept
up a continued questioning; but I was not to be thrown off my
guard. He, however, only went as far as Warsaw with me, and
then returned to Summerville, while I took the train to Nashville.
His story about the murder, was, doubtless, a hoax, or he would
have gone on with me to La Grange.</p>

<p>Nashville was the only civil place I had been in yet; and there
was less of bitterness than I had seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this place I was met by my father, to whom I had written,
requesting him to meet me there. His journey was made at the
imminent risk of arrest and incarceration in prison; but fortunately
he had a commission from Governor Magoffin, of Kentucky,
on which he got through. As king Isham G. Harris
remarked:</p>

<p>"Col. P&mdash;&mdash;, that is a better pass than I can give you;" and
I believed him when he said it, for at that time Gov. Magoffin's
name would pass a man in either section, and Harris' would not.</p>

<p>In due time we arrived at Portsmouth, Ohio, where my father
was publishing a paper at that time; and the reader may imagine
my joy at again meeting my mother and sister in a land of freedom;
though my joy was marred by the fact that my youngest
brother was lying at the point of death. Three weeks after I
returned, he expired, dying a christian's death, full of hope in
eternal life.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XV.</i></h2>

<div class="center">IN THE UNION SERVICE&mdash;THE KENTUCKY CAMPAIGN.</div>


<p>I had intended on arriving at home to enlist in the Union
army, and under the old starry banner at once, but deferred the
matter on account of my brother's sickness; but within a few
days after his death I enlisted at Portsmouth to join Fremont's
body guard, but eventually went into the 4th Ohio Cavalry,
commanded by Colonel John Kennett. I was sworn into the
service by Lieutenant S. K. Williams, and was sworn into the
4th Cavalry again by Captain O. P. Robie, of Company A, at
Cincinnati, and on the 16th of September, 1861, found myself
at Camp Gurley, undergoing lessons in the intricacies of the
cavalry drill under Sergeant Charles D. Henry, of Company A.</p>

<p>We drew horses soon after I arrived in camp, and after a few
weeks of preparation in tactics and the usual amount of soldier
pranks in the neighborhood, we moved to Camp Dennison, when
on the 20th day of November we were finally mustered into the
service. We remained at Camp Dennison till the latter part of
winter, or the first of spring, when we were ordered into Kentucky.
I was exceedingly sick of the idleness of camp life, and
hailed marching orders with delight, as did all the boys, who,
like myself, delighted in a roving life.</p>

<p>I do not recollect the day of the month on which we left Ohio,
but we at once proceeded to Louisville, stopping a brief period
at Camp Kennett, near Jeffersonville, and in due course of time
found ourselves on the mudbound shores of Bacon creek. This
historic stream derives its name from a circumstance connected
with the early settlement of Kentucky; a lot of hunters having
encamped upon it to bacon their bear meat. This fact I
learned from the "oldest inhabitant," and considering the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and the customs of pioneers, I have no doubt of its
correctness.</p>

<p>At this time we were under command of General O. M.
Mitchell, and it is perhaps unnecessary here to add that men
under so energetic a commander were never idle. We scouted
the country thoroughly in every direction, but did not meet the
enemy at any point willing to give us battle, and hence we had
no fighting in Kentucky. During our trip down Green river,
we all suffered severely from cold and exposure, but the rebels
always retired before us; and perhaps they were right.</p>

<p>On leaving Bacon creek, we marched on Bowling Green,
General Mitchell being, as was usual with him, in great haste to
follow up the flying enemy; and such was his energy, and so
well appointed was everything in his army, that the obstructions
in the roads, upon which the rebels had wasted so much labor,
scarcely formed an impediment to his march. He had a regiment
of pioneers from Michigan who were the best working
men I ever saw, and they cleared the way for the advance with
a rapidity almost unparalleled.</p>

<p>The army advanced on Bowling Green while the detachment
I was with was on a scout down Green river; and on coming
in, Captain Robie and myself galloped our horses all the way
from Mumfordsville to Bowling Green, a distance of thirty-four
miles. About a mile from Mumfordsville we found, by the
side of the railroad, the corpse of a boy belong to General
Sill's old regiment; he had died at a hospital near by, and the
steward had sent three other sick men to carry the body to
Mumfordsville, and they had sunk exhausted by the road. A
train which had been out in that direction refused to take the
body on for the men, and while I was looking at the corpse the
same engine came back, and when it stopped I called the conductor,
but he refused with an oath to take the body on the train,
saying he had enough live men on. This enraged me considerably,
and I drew a pistol on him, which had a very decided effect
indeed, and he helped to put the corpse on the train. He,
however, threatened to report me for stopping him, but at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
moment Captain Robie came up, and the fellow found it convenient
to have nothing more to say. I suppose he delivered
the corpse in Mumfordsville, but he was mean enough to throw
it off the train. The boy was a fine looking youth&mdash;sixteen
years of age, and the sight of it and of the exhausted, sorrow-stricken
soldiers, would have melted any but a heart of stone.</p>

<p>We arrived at Bowling Green just as Captain Loomis, of the
Coldwater Battery, from Michigan, was shelling the Johnnies
out of the place. At the instant I rode up to the river bank, I
espied General Mitchell with his hat off, calling for volunteers&mdash;I
did not know for what&mdash;but I volunteered, when I discovered
that it was to carry a rope over Big Barren river, in order to
enable him to swing a pontoon over the stream. Sergeant
Frank Robie, another soldier and myself, mounted a little raft
made of plank, on which we put a coil of rope, and then we
pushed out, paying out the coil as we went. The raft was a
small, frail structure, and the current setting against the rope
made it swing up and down, so that we were frequently in the
water up to our knees, and as the river ran very swiftly, the
reader may very well imagine that we had a dangerous ride of
it, to say nothing about the bullets of the rebels, from the
opposite shore&mdash;about twenty of which were fired at us while we
were engaged in the work, though luckily none of them took
effect; but our infantry firing soon made the reprobates "light
out" from their position.</p>

<p>Captain Loomis knocked the stack off the locomotive just as
the train loaded with rebel soldiers was about to start out, and
they barely had time to save themselves as we entered the town.</p>

<p>We finally got a rope over, through the protection afforded us
by our infantry, and by the assistance of Lieutenant Shoemaker,
of the Fourth Cavalry, Captain Yates, of the engineers, began
throwing in his pontoons. The bridge would soon have been
completed; but, at this point, General Mitchell rode up, and
told us we could all go to bed now, as some of the men had
found a ferry boat two miles below, which was capable of conveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
two hundred men, and that that would be sufficient to accomplish
his purpose.</p>

<p>Part of the 19th Illinois and 18th Ohio infantry were double-quicked
down the river, at once, to the boat, and crossed over,
and then double-quicked up again, on the opposite side of the
stream to the town, in time to drive out the rear guard of the
rebels&mdash;some five hundred in number, who were busily engaged
in destroying the place.</p>

<p>On the first night after our arrival at Bowling Green, an attempt
was made to fire the stables where our horses were, with a view
to the destruction of the animals; but Providence favored us,
and the wind suddenly changed, and the flames did not communicate
to the buildings. Had they done so, our stock would
have certainly perished in the flames, as we could not have
released the horses in time. Seven large brick buildings were
destroyed, and some frames were burned, between the stables
and the public square. These were the first ones fired, and the
incendiaries believed the flames would reach the stables, and
destroy both horses and equipments; but their purposes were
foiled, by the shifting of the wind.</p>

<p>On the following morning, detachments of our cavalry scoured
the country in every direction, capturing a great many rebels,
who were destroying property and pillaging houses, passing
themselves off as federal soldiers. It was a common game and
one easily played, amid the panic and excitement that followed
the fall of Bowling Green; the people having been made to believe
there was no crime too vile for the "Northern vandals." But
the cavalry soon came over, and the citizens could readily discover
the difference, and they began, at once, to inform us where
these rebel depredators were to be found.</p>

<p>Seven hundred rebels were reported in the vicinity of Russelville,
while yet others were prowling around in the county, and
Lieutenant Harris with a small detachment was sent out to destroy
the railroad, of which party I was one. We went to
South Union, in Logan county, where I was sent out with seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
men a short distance below, to stand picket. While on duty, a
very remarkable looking man rode up to me and said:</p>

<p>"I am told you have come here to protect citizens in their
lives and property."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "that is our purpose."</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "my name is Ray; I am a physician,
and I own an interest in a large steam mill, five miles further
down in the country, and it is to be burned to-night by the Texas
Rangers; twenty-five of whom were detailed to burn it, and
several others in the county. Can you do anything to save it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was my response, "get my men some supper,
while I go back and see my commanding officer."</p>

<p>I went to see the Lieutenant, back at the town, while Dr. Ray
was preparing supper for the squad. The Lieutenant at once
gave me permission to go to the mill, if I desired to do so;
and, after reaching the picket post, the Doctor came with the
provisions, and I told him I was ready. We started immediately
for the town of Auburn, where the mill was located;
when the Doctor looked anxiously around, and asked:</p>

<p>"Where are your men?"</p>

<p>I told him I did not need any soldiers, but would call on the
citizens for help, and inquired how many could be relied on in
an emergency, and he said about twenty; and I told him that
was enough provided I could get them out. When we reached
the mill, we succeeded in raising but half a dozen men, including
the miller and his employees. I then told the Doctor that
he must go into the mill and pile all the empty barrels up as high
as he could reach, so that when one pile is pushed over, the whole
lot would tumble down with it, and make a great racket.
"Then," I said, "I will fire off my gun, and then you knock the
empty barrels about, and shout: 'Turn out the guard;' and 'Fall
in, men,' and we will make as much noise as if there was an
hundred of us," after which I went into the coopershop to instruct
the men. There were several good places for protection
in the shop, from which they were to fire on any advancing
party, after I had discharged the signal gun; and to all my arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the party agreed. The miller then went to his house
and brought down hot biscuits, fresh butter, sweet milk and eggs,
for a lunch, which we greedily consumed; after which two of
the party went out to patrol the vicinity. We kept turn now
guarding till about eleven o'clock at night, when one of the
men came running in, almost breathless with excitement, saying,
that they were coming from down the road.</p>

<p>I stationed the men to my notion, and began to walk a beat before
the mill, taking good care to make sufficient noise with my
saber, resolved to attract attention. Very soon a small party of
horsemen came at a gallop toward us; and when they were
within gunshot, I shouted "halt," and immediately fired on
them. The effect was magical. The rebels wheeled in confusion,
running for their lives; while my men fired upon them
as fast as they could, and the old doctor thundered the barrels
about, and yelled like a madman.</p>

<p>The enemy were ignominiously defeated&mdash;put to flight. The
doctor jumped and capered with joy, to see the effect of our
strategy; it even seemed to make him young again. As soon
as the excitement was over, we reloaded our pieces, piled up our
barrels, and waited for a second attack, as we felt certain they
would not give it up that way; but notwithstanding our expectations
they did, and we were not disturbed by that party.</p>

<p>However, just after midnight another party advanced upon us,
and we again stood on the defensive; but no sooner did I challenge
the advancing men, than I recognized the voice of Major Dreisbach,
of the 4th Ohio Cavalry, and among the men was Captain
Robie, of Company A; and we were not obliged to renew either
our firing or our strategy.</p>

<p>From this place I was sent to Russelville, to ascertain the
strength of the force there, and such other particulars as would
be of advantage to the service. I rode rapidly, in order to get
in the town at night, and out again before daylight, so that I
might obtain and communicate the desired information, before
he came near enough to engage the enemy. They were represented
at seven hundred strong; while the Major's command
only numbered one hundred men. I succeeded in getting into
the town, and rousing some of the inhabitants, represented myself
as a confederate quartermaster, and asked them to tell me
where the Texas Rangers were, and inquired about Col. Wharton
and other rebel officers, with the air of an old acquaintance.
They informed me that the regiment had left town about an hour
before; but if I would hurry on, I would overtake them at
Whippoorwill Station; and that they intended to burn the
bridge at that place, and would be delayed a short time. I
next inquired about the government property there; and one
man went to show me the different stores of flour and other
provisions, of which there was an immense quantity in town;
after which I went to Grey's tavern and ordered breakfast for a
hundred Texan Rangers, telling him to have it ready for us just
at daylight, which he promised to do, and I rode off to our command.</p>

<span class="caption">"The sergeant of the guard, without a word, ran at him, seized him by the arms, and clasping both of them down to his
sides, stooped under him, and threw him clear across the railroad track."&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_247">247</a>.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> this was done so quickly and coolly, that the citizens were
not alarmed, and we even captured some of Wharton's men who
were sleeping in town, at various houses; while the amount of
stores which fell into our hands, was immense.</p>

<p>The landlord had taken me at my word, and we had a splendid
breakfast, which had been prepared for the Rangers, who,
alas, for my veracity, turned out to be real blue-coated Yankees.
However, we devoured our meal with as much relish, and as great
an amount of enjoyment, as if we had come from the banks of
the Rio Grande, and ridden all the way to Russelville in a day.
To tell the truth, we were fearfully hungry, and did as hungry
men do.</p>

<p>Circumstances were such that the troops were soon recalled
from the town, and they evacuated it, while I was down on the
Tennessee line, whither I had been sent on another scout, by
the Major. When I returned, I found myself alone, and twenty-seven
miles from our lines. On passing through, I discovered
that the people had commenced to carry off the public stores;
and I at once ordered them to stop, telling them if they did not,
I would bring a company of men and lay the town in ashes; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
my threat had the desired effect. At the depot I found another
gang rolling out the flour, and hauling it off in wagons, and I
gave them the same warning, but they did not yield so readily.
They asked me if I possessed the authority to make the order,
and if I was a commissioned officer, etc. This fretted me a
little, and drawing my pistol, I rode in among them, and made
them roll every barrel back into the depot again; and then
shutting and barring the doors, I told them I would kill the next
man I found near the place.</p>

<p>While I was down at Allensville, I met a two-horse carriage,
in which were four old men and one young man, who seemed to
be about twenty-five years of age. Entering into a conversation
with them, I soon discovered that the old men were Union
men, and that they had got stuck on some confederate money,
and that they were going to Nashville to dispose of it for Kentucky
State notes; but the young man, as if trying to draw my
sentiments from me, expressed himself in the bitterest terms as
a rebel. While the conversation was going on, one of the old
gentlemen produced a flask of whisky, and passed it first to the
other three, and then to me; asking at the same time, if I ever
drank. I told them that I seldom drank anything stronger than
brandy, and "laid hold." Raising the flask, I said, gentlemen,
let us drink to the Constitution and the Union; when the old
men shouted "hurrah for the Constitution and the Union,"
The young man, however, put his head out and fairly yelled:
"No, sir, I'm a rebel; I won't drink any such sentiment; I
will die first." My first impulse was to thrust my pistol in his
face and blow his brains out; but he was unarmed and I would
not shoot a defenseless man.</p>

<p>I was alone, and could not be bothered with prisoners; but I
was fully determined to punish him in some way. Without answering
his vehement expostulation, I turned up the flask and
drank very leisurely, without the least show of anger, and then
riding close to the carriage, I took the flask in my left hand,
and passed it to the young villain, and drawing my pistol with
my right, I deliberately leveled it on his breast, and said calmly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"Now, sir, you will drink or die;" and I meant it, for that was
the only chance I intended to give him for his life. He seized
the flask with trembling hand, his face pale with fright, and, in
spite of his recent boasting refusal, he drank until I got afraid
I would make him kill himself with whisky, and told him he
could stop; that I did not want him to drown himself with
Bourbon. Then giving him a few words of counsel, I allowed
them all to proceed on their journey, and I turned my attention
to the depot, which was surrounded by a villainous looking
crowd of disappointed rebels, who had probably met to counsel
over the evacuation of Kentucky and their own fate.</p>

<p>There were seven hundred barrels of corn at Auburn, three
hundred barrels at Russellville, seven hundred at McCloud's
switch, one hundred barrels at Whippoorwill, and as much
more at Allensville; and at all of these places there were considerable
quantities of wheat, and at Russellville there were
stores of mess beef, pork, flour, and arms. I felt that all these
things should not be left without a guard, and I well knew we
had no men to spare, so I put each depot, and all the stores in
the vicinity, in charge of the nearest wealthy citizen, telling him
I would hold him responsible for the safety of the buildings and
their contents; and that if a dollar's worth was lost or destroyed,
he would be compelled to make compensation.</p>

<p>After this, I returned to Bowling Green, and reported my
proceedings to Colonel Stanley, who was post commandant
there. He approved my proceedings, and directed me to hold
the things, till he could send down a guard, which I did, riding
from one end to the other of my beat every day&mdash;a distance of
thirty-two miles.</p>

<p>As soon as our forces had repaired the railroad, they began
to remove all the stores to Bowling Green, and I was relieved
from guard duty, and returned to South Union, on my way to
Bowling Green. Here I was taken sick, with something bordering
on pneumonia, and I was compelled to stop at the house of
the agent of the Shakers, a venerable man, named Shannon.
The women of the society took me into the house, and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a bed for me, and nursed me with the greatest care, until I was
well enough to travel again. I was walking about in three or
four days, and at that time a justice of the peace, named Carson,
from Butler county, came to see me, telling me of two men,
named Robinson and Keaton, terrors to his neighborhood,
who were constantly committing depredations. They claimed
to be Union soldiers; but my informant stated that they robbed
all they came to, regardless of their political sentiments.</p>

<p>All I could do in this matter, was to arrest the men, and take
them to Bowling Green; and it was sixteen miles from where I
was, to the place where the depredations were committed. I
started, however, for the scene of the troubles, and on my way
I met a man named Mobly, and another named Gines, who were
known guerrillas, and who had done much mischief in the country.
I told them I was informed that they were good, law abiding
citizens, and I wished them to join me, and help me arrest a
couple of men, who were "raising Cain" down below.</p>

<p>At first they objected, and did not at all like to go. One
made an excuse that his wife was sick, and had no wood chopped;
and he must hurry home and cut some; while the other (I believe
it was Mobly), said that he was necessarily compelled to
go to mill, otherwise his family "had obleeged to suffer."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" I asked; and they pointed in the direction,
which, as I suspected, was exactly contrary to the one
they were riding. My suspicions were well-founded; they were
just then going somewhere to plot, or execute mischief; they
were mounted on extraordinarily fine horses, and appeared like
very resolute men. I remarked that from the direction they
were traveling, I did not think they were going to attend to
domestic affairs; and added: "I am a United States officer,
and you can not refuse to assist me." Seeing that no excuse
would avail, they went along; but I made it a point to put them
in the road in front of me, so I could watch them. When I
named the men I intended to arrest, they were greatly relieved;
they were rejoiced at getting rid of two such men, as the ones
referred to, who were their bitter enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>They even threw off all appearance of reluctance, and went
with me willingly. Passing through the little town, I had another
man pointed out to me as one who had been in the Woodbury
fight only a short time before, and had come recently
from the rebel army; and hailing him, without arousing his suspicion
that I knew anything of his antecedents, I told him the
same that I had told the others. He tried to beg off, pleading
a sick wife; but I informed him I could not possibly excuse
him; for if I excused him I must do the same for the others, as
they had made a similar request. I stated that he had been
recommended to me as a very proper man for the work; that he
was anxious to restore law and order, and I could, under no circumstances,
dispense with his services. He then invited me to
dine with him, while his boy caught his horse, which I readily
consented to do. We then mounted and rode in the direction
of Kitchen's still-house, where the parties were supposed to be.
There had just been a religious meeting in the neighborhood of
the still-house, and a large number of men&mdash;good Union men,
too&mdash;had gathered around to drink whisky, and talk politics;
and among the number were Keaton and Robinson. I gave my
rifle to Porter while I arrested Robinson, leaving Porter to
guard the prisoner while I took Keaton into custody. I then
gave their arms to my citizen guards, and we mounted them on
their horses, and made for Bowling Green, followed by threats and
execrations of Union men, who did not know their real character.
The last thing I heard was the voice of the old man Kitchen,
who shouted that he had forty men and thirty muskets,
and he would have the men away from me before we got five
miles, adding: "The secesh are having a good time, to-day, arresting
Union men with federal soldiers;" but he did not know
the joke I had in store for the secesh. The next day I reached
Bowling Green, after traveling nearly all night, with my prisoners,
who were turned over to Col. Stanley, at the same time preferring
charges against each.</p>

<p>I only claimed to have captured five prisoners; but Col. Stanley
(of the 18th Ohio) tells the story differently. I had barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
got my prisoners delivered to the Colonel, when the old man
Kitchen, who really was a good Unionist, got to Bowling Green
with about forty men, and demanded to know why Keaton
and Robinson had been arrested. The Colonel answered him
politely, and was about to dismiss him and his squad, when a
well-known Union man identified three bushwhackers in the
party, and the Colonel, who had an aversion for that class of
men, ordered them all to be arrested and sent to jail. I do not
know what ever became of the party, but Col. Stanley always
told the story that I had brought him eight prisoners single-handed.</p>

<p>While at Shaker Town I wrote out the following advertisement
for T. J. Shannon and other loyal citizens:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><b>6 1-4 CENTS REWARD!</b></div>

<p>"Ran away from the town of Bowling Green, in Warren county, Kentucky,
one George W. Johnson, who claimed to be Provisional Governor
of Kentucky. No inquiry would have been made concerning his whereabouts,
but for the fact that he had notified the people of Kentucky that
they must pay their taxes to him, for the benefit of the so-styled Confederate
States of America; and whereas, the people of Kentucky, and Logan
county in particular, are law-abiding citizens, and desire earnestly to pay
their taxes promptly, and the said George W. Johnson and his ten legal
advisers having absconded, and the sheriff appointed by said "legal advisers"
being afraid to act, the citizens of Logan county will pay the above
reward for his apprehension; but no thanks for his return. The person
claiming the reward is to change a $20 Confederate States note at its face."</p>

<div class="right"> "<span class="smcap">Many Citizens.</span>"</div>
<p>"<i>Feb.</i> 22, 1862."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advertisement was duly posted in three conspicuous
places, but the money was never claimed. Johnson was afterward
arrested, as I learn, but the captor never asked the reward.
Death overtook him at Shiloh.</p>

<p>At the same place, I captured a rebel soldier, named Blewitt,
and took him before Esquire Holland, where he took the oath
of allegiance. We had no form of that oath before us, but the
'squire fixed up one strong enough, and he was about to administer
it when a venerable old Shaker said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friend James, thee had better swear him not to break open
any more beehives;" and he insisted on a clause to that effect
being inserted. The oath, however, was strong enough, when
we were through with it.</p>

<p>I now started out in search of my regiment, which, by this
time, had nearly reached Nashville. Going by way of Russellville,
I got a comrade, who had been wounded when we charged
the town. He was an Italian, named Garanchini. I had left
him in care of parties at Russellville, and now that he was able
to travel, I took him with me, proceeding by way of Springfield.
We had no trouble in getting through the country, although we
were the first Federals who had appeared in that section of the
State.</p>

<p>We found the regiment at Camp Jackson, seven miles south
of Nashville, which point we made a base for a great number
of scouting adventures, in every section of the country, as we
lay there for a considerable length of time.</p>

<p>I was very proud to learn that the 4th Ohio Cavalry had captured
the city of Nashville, and that members of that regiment
should be the first Federal soldiers to tread the streets of this
stronghold of secession. Had "King" Harris known, at the
time I applied to him for a pass, in company with my father,
that I would become a member of the regiment which demanded
and received the surrender of his capital, it is altogether probable
that the petty monarch would have held me to a more strict
accountability. As there was a misunderstanding soon after as
to what troops captured the city, and not wishing to see my
comrades robbed of their hard-earned glory, I beg leave to present
the following, which is to the point, and, I think, will exhibit
the affair in its proper light to every impartial reader:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">COPY OF H. C. RODGERS' LETTER TO J. KENNETT.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Jno. Kennett</span>:
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;According to my recollection, the Second Division commanded
by Brig. Gen. Mitchell, advanced upon Nashville from Bowling
Green, in the latter part of the month of February, 1862.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
On this march, the advance was led by the 4th O. V. C., Col. John Kennett
commanding. On, or about the 25th, the regiment marched to, and occupied,
Edgefield Junction, some eight or ten miles from Nashville. From
this place, Col. Kennett immediately ordered forward a detachment of the
4th O. V. C., under my command, with instructions to occupy the village
of Edgefield, opposite the city of Nashville, to take possession of all steamboats,
or other native craft lying there, and to hold the position. These
orders were fully executed&mdash;the detachment finding no enemy in Edgefield&mdash;a
few straggling cavalry in Nashville&mdash;my command occupied Edgefield,
two days before the command of Gen. Nelson arrived; during which
time the Mayor of Nashville twice came over to Edgefield, for the purpose
of surrendering the city: on his second visit, the city was surrendered.
The mayor, Cheatham, tendering, and Col. Kennett receiving, the surrender.
This took place at the residence of Mr. Fuller, in Edgefield. Mr.
Fuller, myself and some others, whom I do not remember, were present.
This occurrence took place the day before Gen. Nelson's command arrived.</p>

<p>The battery of Capt. Loomis, at the time of this surrender, occupied a
position commanding, and within pistol shot of, the heart of the city. The
4th O. V. C. could have occupied the city of Nashville at any time after
the occupation of Edgefield, had their instructions permitted it; in fact, a
small squad did cross over to the city and back again, on the ferry-boat we
had captured.</p>

<p>Mayor Cheatham was anxious to surrender the city, through fear we
might shell it, and, in surrendering, he agreed to protect the public property
until it was delivered to the United States' officers.</p>

<p>Capt. Loomis' battery was under the direction, at this time, of Col. Kennett.</p>

<p>Generals Buell and Mitchell both, certainly, must have known of the
surrender of Nashville before the arrival of Gen. Nelson.</p>

<p>I, myself, brought to them the news of Nelson's arrival, two days after
Edgefield was occupied by us.</p>

<div class="right">Yours, truly,<br />
[Signed.] <span class="smcap">H. C. Rodgers</span>,<br />
Major 4th O. V. C.<br />

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">AFTER JOHN MORGAN.</div>


<p>The celebrated John H. Morgan was then in our front, doing
his best to achieve <i>notoriety</i>, which he afterward succeeded in
doing. To keep him in his place caused us much inconvenience;
indeed, he was troublesome, and Gen. Mitchell resolved to drive
him out of the country, if he could not catch or kill him. But
before being successful, it became necessary to know exactly
where to find him, and just how many men he had. The General
told me what he wanted, and asked me if I would go down
the country and hunt him up, and I replied that I would. He
then gave orders that I should be fitted out to my own notion, and
Captain Prentice, the Assistant Adjutant General, furnished me
with a citizen's dress, and the General gave me his own saddle
pony to ride, as it was the only unbranded horse in the camp.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, I put out from our lines in the night, and took
the road to Murfreesboro. I had a lonely ride till morning,
when I stopped at a house on Stewart's creek, to get breakfast;
and there I fell in with a man who stated that he was going to
Murfreesboro, and proposed to ride with me; and, of course, I
was glad of his company. From the familiar way he spoke of
Hardee, and other southern officers, I felt satisfied he was a
rebel scout, and had just been to Nashville. He was a large,
well-built man, with homely features, but expressive of a good
deal of cunning. He was very bitter against the Yankees, in
his conversation, and could tell me more meanness they had
done, than I ever before thought they could devise. All this I
stored away, as "stock in trade," to be reproduced to the Johnnies
themselves, when occasion should require me to abuse my
friends.</p>

<p>We crossed Stewart's and Overall's creeks, when we met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the first rebel pickets, standing in a field some distance away.
As we approached they stepped up to know our business, where
we were from, where we were going, etc. My companion was
in a hurry to proceed, but I desired to converse with the pickets
to get whatever information I could from them. They were as
loquacious as I was, and had much to say about a fight they had
been in a few days before, with the 4th Ohio cavalry, magnifying
their own exploits hugely. They represented the 4th Ohio as
little better than arrant cowards, which worried me a good deal,
but I must keep up my disguise. Little did they imagine that
they were then speaking with a member of that very regiment;
and less did they suspect that my fingers were aching to shoot
them. If the General had not given me such very strict orders,
I believe I should have stopped right there and given them a
fight. But a severer trial than that, even, was in store. One of
the reprobates walked up to me, and with a flourish and an oath,
handed me a pistol, saying it had been taken from the 4th Ohio
cavalry the day before, and that Captain Morgan had come in,
at the same time, with eight buckled around him. I examined
the weapon, and although it looked very familiar, I handed it
back, and told him I had never seen one like it before.</p>

<p>Next my curiosity was excited by their guns; I represented that
I had never seen any like them, and innocently wondered if the
Yankees had any of the same pattern.</p>

<p>"No," said the man, "these are English guns;" and there,
sure enough, on the lock was the crown and the words "Tower,
London," stamped on the metal. There were but three men at
the post, and when the fellow gave me his pistol, their guns were
in a corner of the fence and they at some distance from them, so
that I could have shot all three before they could have helped
themselves.</p>

<p>No passes were required from men going south, but no one
could travel north, without a pass from Hardee. On arriving at
Murfreesboro, I found it was guarded by Morgan's battalion of
cavalry, and three companies of Texas rangers. Now, I had not
the least idea of staying at the place, but had intended to ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
through; and was proceeding along steadily, but carelessly, on
the lower side of the public square, when I was hailed by a former
acquaintance on the sidewalk. He was an old friend, and had
served with me in Johnston's regiment, in Texas. I had intended
to pass under the name of George Adams, but up to this time
had never been questioned as to who I was; and it was very fortunate,
as otherwise I should have been detected on the spot.</p>

<p>While talking with this man, a crowd soon assembled around
me, to inquire the news from Kentucky, and wanting to know
how I had possibly managed to get through the Yankee lines, and
a hundred other such questions. I told them I had crossed the
Tennessee sixteen miles below Nashville, at the mouth of Pond
creek, and hence did not come through the lines at all, but flanked
them, coming down Richland creek, and crossing the Charlotte
pike at Davidson's. I had been at home on a visit, I said, and
was going back to Texas. When asked where I lived, I told them
in Bourbon county, Kentucky; and when further questioned as
to my motive for returning to Texas, I told them I had been
making that State my home for years; and there was my Texan
friend by whom to prove it.</p>

<p>As soon as I could do so, I turned to the ranger and asked
him so many questions, that he had no time to interrogate me.
While I was standing in the crowd, asking and answering questions
by turn, a very fine looking man dressed in a plain black
suit of clothes, walked leisurely up, and stood listening to the
conversation. He at length addressed me in a mild but deep and
manly voice, and inquired if I was from near Lexington. I told
him that I was, and he asked the news from that locality, and I
was giving him the "local items" in detail, when an officer stepped
up to him and addressing him as Captain Morgan, called him
away on business.</p>

<p>Well, for a little while the top of my head got cold, and the
blood all rushed to my heart; but I do not think my emotions
were betrayed in my face, for, in an instant, the danger of my
position occurred to me in full force, and I resumed my devil-may-care
manner, but surveyed him closely as he walked off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
He was a man about five feet ten or eleven inches in hight, fair
complexion, rather red cheeks, round, manly features, with a
light blue or gray eye, fiery red goattee of full dimensions, and
a little coarse, light-brown hair, slightly inclined to red, which
was closely cut. His appearance was genteel, and his manners
very prepossessing. He appeared to be a general favorite, as
all eyes appeared to follow him, as he walked along with his fellow
officers; and, perhaps, this was the reason that my very
close investigation of him passed unnoticed by the men around
me. I could not help feeling a little proud that I would now be
able to report to Gen. Mitchell that I had seen the very man he
had sent me out to find.</p>

<p>After Morgan had left, my Texas friend remarked that there
were a great many Lexington boys in Morgan's battalion. I
then asked him if there were any in town.</p>

<p>"Well, no," he said; then turning to a man at his side he
asked:</p>

<p>"Is Jim B&mdash;&mdash; in town?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, to my great relief; "he is out on picket;
we are looking for him in every minute."</p>

<p>This Jim. B&mdash;&mdash; was born at Leesburg, the place of my nativity,
and could have identified me as an Ohio man. Without, however,
appearing to be disconcerted, I expressed my regret that
I was not able to wait and see him. Then turning the conversation,
by asking if there were any Bourbon "boys" in the command,
I pretty soon found it convenient to excuse myself without
cultivating any further acquaintance. My companion was
now ready to go, and coming up, mounted his horse and we rode
for Shelbyville.</p>

<p>About five miles from town, I became sick&mdash;very sick; growing
worse so rapidly that I was compelled to stop at a house.
I was well aware that my companion was extremely anxious to
reach Shelbyville that night; and, as for myself, I didn't want
to get there at all. Stating my demoralized physical condition
to him, I told him I was sorry we must part, but I must stop;
so pulling up to a house by the roadside, I bade him "good-bye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The "man of the house," whose name was Bidford, invited
me in, and put up my horse. I had now cleared myself of my
companion, and, therefore, recovered very rapidly. It was about
five o'clock in the evening when I stopped, and shortly after,
supper was ready, and I did it ample justice; and then, as soon
as it was dark, I retired to bed. A great number of rebels were
traveling along the road, and several of them stopped at Bidford's
house for water and to have their horses fed. During
the night I was there, an officer, with considerable of an escort,
came in, and as there was but a thin partition separating the
rooms occupied by us, I could hear every word he said. His
name was Wood, and he was lieutenant colonel of the 1st Louisiana
cavalry, and was on his way to Murfreesboro with orders
for Captain Morgan, and to Nashville with dispatches to Gen.
Buell. He talked a great deal, and seemed to be on very intimate
terms with my landlord.</p>

<p>Next morning I left early, taking the road to Shelbyville
till I got out of sight of the house, when I took the first road
that turned off, and started on my return to our own camp. At
one point on the Las Casas road, I saw a detachment of Morgan's
men coming down the road toward me. To be caught
trying to go north would cause my arrest, if no other reason
existed for it; so I turned into a lane, and quickened my gait.
They pursued, and it was a tight race for about a mile, when I
dodged them in a dense cedar brake; but I was driven a long
way from my course. After wandering about for a good while,
I rode up to a house, and was asking the woman about the way
to Las Casas, when I heard a horse coming at a swift trot behind
me, and turning in my saddle, lo! there was one of Morgan's
men coming toward me, entirely without suspicion.</p>

<p>Turning to him, I remarked that I was glad to see him; that
I wanted directions how to go to Brown's mill. I knew the way
beyond that well enough, and had no necessity for inquiry farther.
When he asked me where I was going, after exacting secrecy
from him, which he readily promised, I told him that I was
a Texas Ranger; that I had put on a citizen's suit to favor my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
plan; that I wanted to get into the country, as near to the Yankee
lines as possible, in order to ascertain what had become of a
very dear friend of mine, who had been missing since the day
of our last fight with the 4th Ohio cavalry.</p>

<p>"I want to find out," said I, "what has become of him, so
that I can send word to his people, and advise them of his fate."</p>

<p>"Who is your friend?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "his name is Corniel Warfield; he is an old
friend of mine, and I will risk my life to find out what has become
of him."</p>

<p>"Corniel Warfield," he repeated slowly, and with surprise; he
belongs to my company. "Certainly I will do all I can to assist
you, sir; he is a special friend of mine; I will go with you a
mile or so, and put you in the right road to the mill; but you
must not let the Yankees catch you."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," I said, "I will be sharp enough for that."</p>

<p>The fellow actually went a mile and a half with me, and put
me on the road I sought, when he parted with me, wishing me
every success. Thanking him, I "shook my pony up" with the
spurs, and was soon out of sight, on the direct route to Nashville.</p>

<p>I had nursed this same Warfield, in our regimental hospital,
the night after the fight; and knew very well where he was at
the time.</p>

<p>I had only one more ugly place to pass, and that was La
Vergne. I had heard a ranger say, in Murfreesburro, that a
party of them would be in La Vergne, that night, so that I knew
I must be on my guard, when I approached the town. I rode
at the side of the turnpike, on soft ground, and as it was after
night, I passed unnoticed, until my horse's feet struck the plank
which formed the crossing at the railroad, when almost instantly
I heard the sound of some horses running down from a grove
some distance to the left of the road. I "shook" pony again
with the spurs, and away we went. Looking back, now, I saw
the rebels wheel into the road after me. I waited to see no
more, but struck out for our picket post, as hard as my horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could gallop. The Johnnies did not follow me more than two
miles before they began to be afraid of running on our pickets;
and I, too, had my fears; there was danger that our own men
would fire on me unless I checked up in time; but luckily, I
was recognized when I came in sight, and the boys of course did
not shoot.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">RECONNOITERING MIDDLE TENNESSEE&mdash;SCOUTING AS CAPTAIN BONHAM
OF THE FIRST LOUISIANA CAVALRY.</div>


<p>I was soon at the General's quarters, and waked him out of
a sound nap&mdash;the only time I ever found him asleep, though I
have visited his quarters at all hours of the day and night. He
was pleased with what I had done, and sent me away for a little
rest and sleep, previous to starting out again.</p>

<p>In a few hours we started out with a detachment of cavalry
and some infantry, among which was the 10th Ohio, mounted
in wagons; and I have no doubt but we should have caught John
right there, and thus addled the embryo general in the shell,
but, as luck would have it, we met Colonel Wood, with the dispatches
from Hardee to Buell, with Morgan, and about thirty
picked men, as an escort. We halted, and then returned and
delivered the dispatches to General Mitchell, who was not at all
gratified at our meeting, as the Johnnies would know at once
that we were meditating an attack on them.</p>

<p>While Colonel Wood and the General were talking, one of
Morgan's men broke from the rear and started back to Murfreesburro,
at his best speed; but anticipating something of that
kind, Colonel Kennett had quietly sent a few men down the
road, in the rear of the rebels, one of whom caught the Johnnie
and brought him back to our camp. Morgan and Wood were
astounded at the man's conduct; and General Mitchell was in a
rage at the man's treachery, and held the officers responsible for
it. He now had an excellent opportunity to keep the whole
party as prisoners of war, and he submitted the subject to General
Buell, who overruled him, and Morgan was allowed to return
to his command, and he "skedaddled" without delay, and
subsequently caused us much anxiety of mind, and many hard
marches.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> after this, Captain Robie was sent with Company A,
of the 4th Ohio Cavalry, to McMinnville, on a scout, and I
was one of the party. The remainder of the regiment went to
Tullahoma, and other parts, and we were to concentrate at that
place. At McMinnville, we heard of some commands of rebels
in our immediate vicinity, any one of which was superior to us
in number. I had not started from camp with the Captain, but
coming in with a small body of scouts, who had been detailed by
Colonel Kennett, to serve with me, I was told to push on and
overtake him as speedily as possible. He had passed through
McMinnville several hours before I got there; and while I was
ascertaining which road he had taken, I was warned of the near
approach of a party of rebels, by several persons&mdash;some of doubtful
loyalty. I replied that we were fighting men and that we
would be glad to meet Captain Bledsoe and Captain McHenry,
and their commands, and give them battle. "We shall be camped
on this road a short distance out," said I, "and you will confer
a favor on us, to send these men word to that effect."</p>

<p>This they promised to do, telling me that Bledsoe had three
hundred men, McHenry two hundred, and another man, whom
they named, one hundred; and that the farthest command away
was but five miles. Charging them again to be sure and send
the rebels out, we took the road to Manchester, and, after dark,
overtook the company in camp, when I told the captain about
the rebels and the challenge I had sent them, and he approved
it, and immediately put his camp in order for defense.</p>

<p>I was sent a quarter of a mile to the rear, with my party, to barricade
the road, and hold it till the enemy made a demonstration.
During the latter part of the night they approached us cautiously
from the rear, but did not attack us, nor show themselves in
any formidable numbers, but moved around and got on the Manchester
road ahead of us, and charged down on the camp. But
the captain had so disposed his men that they gave the assailants
two sweeping volleys in their flanks as they approached; and perfectly
astounded, they broke and fled, pell mell, back in the way
they came. One of their men, a lieutenant, tumbled headlong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
into our camp. We afterward ascertained that the rebel loss was
eight killed and thirteen wounded; but this only came to our
knowledge some time afterward. Captain Robie only reported
one of them being left dead on the field, and his own loss
nothing. We were unmolested after that, and reached Tullahoma
in time to join the regiment.</p>

<p>The Colonel had been at Manchester, and destroyed the powder
mill there, and had driven a number of little squads of the
enemy out of the country; and having consolidated his command,
we moved in the direction of Murfreesboro, where our
army then was, going by the way of Shelbyville.</p>

<p>Murfreesboro was taken by a detachment of the 4th Ohio
Cavalry under Lieut. Col. Henry Burdsal.</p>

<p>While the 3d division lay at Murfreesboro, Gen. Mitchel sent
me out on a long scout to inspect all the roads leading to Shelbyville,
and all the bridges over the river within five miles of the
town, either above or below it. The reader will at once understand
that this was a very long and dangerous task, as the roads
were all picketed by the Texas Rangers and Morgan's battalion,
and small squads of them were scouring the country, day and
night, in every direction. To the right of the turnpike a couple
of miles is a small town, called Middleton, the same place where
Gen. D. S. Stanley gave the rebel cavalry such a trouncing.
Near this little town I met a squad of rebel cavalry under the
command of a lieutenant. I had just turned into the road, and
did not see them until retreat was out of the question; for I was
within half-pistol shot of them. For a moment I felt very bad,
but the next instant resolved to "<i>face</i>" on them, and "<i>bluff</i>"
through. Throwing up my cap, I gave a loud hurrah, as if I
was immensely pleased over something that had just transpired.
My first exclamation was, "Well, boys, I am glad to see you;
how do you all get along, and what is the news from the army?"</p>

<p>"We are all well, I believe," said the lieutenant, eyeing me
closely; "what command do you belong to, sir?"</p>

<p>"O, I belong to the 1st Louisiana Cavalry," said I; "my name
is Bonham, and I am captain of Company I of that regiment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! ha!" he said, dubiously scrutinizing my splendid uniform,
which really had belonged to Captain Bonham, and who
had died while a prisoner in our hands; "then. Captain, allow
me to ask what you are doing so close to the Yankee pickets,
and <i>alone</i>?"</p>

<p>"O," I exclaimed, "I have had such a remarkable adventure,
and if you are not in a hurry, I will give you the particulars."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, we should be pleased to hear it," said the
Lieutenant, still surveying me intently; "but first tell me how
far it is to the Yankee pickets, if you know, for so small a party
of us may be in danger here."</p>

<p>"O, no," said I, "not in the least; for I have just come out
through them, and the picket line is away beyond (north) of Old
Fosterville, as much as three miles."</p>

<p>"Good on your head," said the Lieutenant; "but, Captain,
what in the world were you doing in the Yankee lines?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," I went on, "I was out here in this
neighborhood some time ago, with part of my regiment, on a
scout. We went into camp at night, not far from New
Fosterville, in a secluded place in the big cedar brake, north of
town; after seeing the command all properly disposed for the
night, I with two other officers, in company with Lieutenant Col.
Wood of our regiment, who is, as perhaps you are aware, one
of our most reliable scouts, went out on a reconnoisance toward
the Yankee pickets. Wood, you know, is a perfect dare-devil,
and what do you think he proposes to do? Why, sir, to go to
a house in plain view of the Yankee pickets, and call for a
supper for the whole party. Tickled at this novel proposition,
in the excitement of the moment, we forgot the dictates of
prudence, and consented to go. We had been there for perhaps
an hour or more, and the lady of the house had laid a bountiful
supper on the table, and we were just in the act of sitting down
to eat it, when a little darkey came rushing into the room, in a
terrible fright, saying, "Oh masters, oh Miss Louise, de Yankee
sogers hab dun cum, dey out dar in de road now, an dey all got
hosses. Oh run gemmen, or dey done cotch you in a minute."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Wood and my companions rushed out and broke over a fence in
the back yard, and into the cedar brake, and made good
their escape, followed, of course, by a rapid fire from
the Yankees. I knew very well that I could never be
so fortunate on my wounded leg, for, you see, gentlemen, I
was wounded in a skirmish in Kentucky last winter, and my
right leg is very weak, (at the same time raising my foot from
the stirrup, I showed an ugly scar on my shin, caused by being
kicked by a horse years before), and realizing my inability to
keep up with my more fortunate companions, I deemed it best
to surrender without resistance, for I was afraid the infuriated
wretches might kill me after I gave in, if not before. On passing
my sword over to the officer in charge, who was a first Lieutenant,
judge my surprise to recognize in him an old
acquaintance and friend who used to clerk in the same store
where I was employed in New Orleans. His name was Dobbs,
(he was first Lieutenant of my own company); and he was glad
to see me, and said that he was extremely sorry that I was a
prisoner, but promised to use his influence to make my imprisonment
as light as possible on me. He saw that the men treated
me with respect, and as soon as he got to camp he went in person
to intercede for me with Gen. Mitchell, who kindly paroled
me and gave me the liberty of the cavalry camp; Lieut. Dobbs
promising to become responsible for my safe keeping. The
Lieutenant did everything in his power to make me comfortable,
and took me in his own mess, to eat at his table free of expense.
Of course I appreciated the kindness of so generous a foe, but
still was anxious to recover my liberty. Seeing that it was
manifestly to my advantage to cultivate amicable relations with
my captors, I sought by every means in my power to ingratiate
myself into their favor; and so completely did I win their confidence
that this morning the Lieutenant proposed that I should
accompany him on a short ride beyond the pickets. Of course
I gladly accepted the kind invitation, and, the Lieutenant
borrowing a horse for me from one of his men, we mounted,
when he said that he was going out to a farm house to procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
butter, eggs and milk for his table. After we had got nearly a
mile from the pickets the Lieutenant dismounted, to arrange his
clothing and adjust a "Yankee button," (made by poking a stick
through the cloth) to his suspenders. We were standing beside
a tree when the Lieutenant took off his belt, and laid his pistols
on the ground beside him; then turning his back to me, began
working at his button. There was a chance that promised success.
Springing forward I seized the belt, and drawing a pistol
from it sprang upon the Lieutenant's horse, and galloped away,
leaving him overwhelmed with astonishment at his own foolish
carelessness. Perhaps it was wrong in me thus to betray the
confidence of so generous a man, but Lieutenant, no man knows
how sweet it is to be free, until he has once been a prisoner."</p>

<p>During the delivery of this story, the whole command had
given me the utmost attention; and when I had concluded their
admiration was almost unbounded. The Lieutenant cordially
extended his hand and said:</p>

<p>"Captain, allow me to congratulate you on your very fortunate
escape," while his men expressed their feelings in sundry
remarks, which, although meaningless to a citizen, are very expressive
to a soldier.</p>

<p>"Bully for him," said one.</p>

<p>"Ah, he's a Tartar," said another.</p>

<p>"He's too old for the Yanks," remarked a third.</p>

<p>Seeing that now I had completely disarmed them of suspicion,
I urged my anxiety to rejoin my regiment, and of hearing from
home, and politely wished them a good day and a successful trip,
and galloped away, followed by their congratulations.</p>

<p>As soon as I was well out of their sight, toward Shelbyville,
I turned off on a by-road, and took my way to the "Widow's
bridge." About two miles from this bridge, I stopped to get my
supper, at a house occupied by a widow named Cheatham, who
was a relative of General Cheatham, and of Cheatham, the mayor
of Nashville. She received me with generous hospitality, and
soon provided a bountiful supper for me. Giving my horse time
to rest after eating, for I had to ride all night, I sat and talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to the lady after supper for some time. She had much to say
about General Breckenridge, who had been camped very near
her house, a few days before, and who had paid her a visit. She
was very much flattered at this, and told me that part of the
General's command were camped near, and that there was a
picket post at the far end of the bridge. When night set in, I
called for my horse, and told the lady that I believed I would
ride. It was in the latter part of March, and when I went out to
my horse, the wind was blowing almost a gale, and snow was
drifting in the air profusely. The widow went out through the
storm to see me mounted at the gate. She expressed the liveliest
sympathy for me in having to ride through that dark, cold,
stormy night; and seeing that I had no gloves to draw on, she
sent a negro into the house for a pair of yarn gloves, with instructions
where to find them, and to hurry back, for she was
already getting cold. Presently the negro returned with the
articles, and as I was drawing them on, I began to grumble at
the cold. "Wait a minute," she said, and away she went to the
house, and soon came running back with a very fine white wool
blanket, which she folded like a shawl and threw around me,
pinning it under my chin with her own hands. Bidding this
hospitable lady good bye, I mounted and was soon prowling
around the picket post at the bridge. I discovered that the
structure was in good repair, and that it could be crossed with
safety; then turning up the river, I inspected, in turn, two
others across the stream. While prowling about the second one,
which was only a mile from town, I unexpectedly run into a
company of rebels, who were returning to their camp. I was
just riding out from the bridge, when the sound of horse's feet
approaching attracted my attention. How to escape meeting
them I could not tell; so posting myself by the side of the fence,
under the shadow of a large tree, when they had approached
within a short distance, I sung out "Halt," in a loud and resolute
tone, and in the next breath demanded, "Who comes there?"</p>

<p>"Friends," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Dismount one and advance with the countersign."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't got the countersign," said the commander.</p>

<p>"What do you belong to," I asked.</p>

<p>"Morgan's battalion," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then break from the right," said I, "and pass us by file until
we see what you look like; and if you prove to be confederates,
you may pass in without delay."</p>

<p>Breaking by file, as ordered, they marched by me so close
that I could have touched them with a ten foot pole. Keeping
myself under the shadow of the tree, I pretended to inspect them
as they rode by. When a few files had passed, I sung out, "All
right, captain, you can reform your men."</p>

<p>"Form fours; forward, march," he shouted, and I soon heard his
men clattering over the bridge and cursing it as an old "basket"
that was unsafe to cross, and must soon fall down. They had
not gone more than a few steps before the officer ordered his
men to dismount and lead over by file, swearing that he believed
the bridge would break if they did not do so. Of course this
was information to me. I well knew that I must now ride for
my life, for the trick would be discovered as soon as they
reached the picket on the other side of the bridge. Turning up
the road and keeping on soft ground, I followed until I came to
a "timber" road, running through a cedar brake, where I
turned off, and was soon safe from pursuit in the labyrinth of
ways that ran in all directions through the woods. Keeping up
the country, I passed above the town about five miles, and
hiding my horse in another brake not far from a house, (for I
heard a chicken crow,) I followed the direction of the sound,
and finding the house, roused a darkey, and got some corn bread
and bacon from him, and directions where to find corn for my
horse. I returned to where my animal was hitched, fed him, and
laid down to sleep. I stayed in that brake until the next night,
and then commencing at the upper bridge, I hunted down the
river toward Shelbyville again, and found two more bridges,
besides the one at the town, in good repair.</p>

<p>Riding cautiously as near the town as I could prudently, I
took a good survey of it, but did not add much to my store of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
knowledge. Meeting an old darkey coming along the road, I
stopped him, and in a low tone asked several questions as to
what troops occupied the place, and if the bridge at town was
in good repair. He informed me that the place was occupied
by Morgan's Battalion of Cavalry and part of Wharton's
Hangers; that some of them were quartered in the town, but
the larger part were camped on the south side of the river, and
were picketing the bridge, which was in good condition.</p>

<p>I had now accomplished all that I had been sent to do. I had
learned all about every bridge, and had explored every approach
to Shelbyville from the north side of the river. Feeling glad
that my dangerous duty was over, with a feeling of relief I
turned my horse's head once more toward Murfreesboro', where
in imagination I could see "old Starry," poring over his maps
by candle light, perhaps impatiently awaiting my arrival; but
I was, as railroad men say, "on time," so I did not give myself
any uneasiness on that score. I had not ridden more than three
hundred yards when I saw a couple of men step into the road
only a few yards ahead of me, and then facing me they commanded
me to "halt." Knowing that death was my portion if
captured in that disguise, I instantly spurred my animal forward
at a charge, straight upon them. When within about two
jumps of them, I fired on the right hand man, when he gave an
exclamation of pain and let his gun fall, and the next jump my
horse struck him full in the breast with his knees and knocked
him high in the air, and as he fell to the ground cleared his
body with a bound. The left hand man fired as I passed, and
so close were we to each other that the powder from his gun
stung my face like fine shot. Seeing more men in the cedars on
the right, I threw myself down, Comanche fashion, with my head
by my horse's breast, but not a second too soon, for they sent a
dozen balls whistling after me. Driving the spurs into my
horse, I urged him to his utmost for about three miles, when I
then checked up, to see if I was pursued; but I heard no more
of the rebels that night, and pursued my way unmolested to
camp, where I arrived just as the General was eating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
breakfast. I do not know who it was that was firing on me,
unless I had blundered inside of the rebel pickets in the dark.
The General was very glad that I escaped so well, and praised
me to all the officers for venturing so far. But I soon had
additional cause to feel proud, for my party of scouts were the
first Yankees into Shelbyville, where we captured a bank and put
it under charge of a guard until relieved by the authorities. This
was the only institution in Tennessee which could redeem its
notes; and I afterward learned that it did redeem its entire
circulation in United States currency.</p>

<p>The rebels soon got over their scare and began to trouble us
again. I scouted the country a good while as Captain Bonham,
of the 1st Louisiana Cavalry, but I accomplished nothing more
worthy of narration, except that I had a few single-handed combats
with members of Morgan's command.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">TRIP TO DECATUR&mdash;LIVELY ADVENTURES.</div>


<p>On the 8th of April I was sent by General Mitchell down to
Decatur, to get information as to the state of the country, and
to destroy the railroad bridge at that point, if possible. I set
out for Shelbyville, mounted on old Punch, my pet horse, properly
armed and fully equipped with turpentine and matches, to do
the required work. "Old Starry," (our pet name for General
Mitchell), "blowed me up" that morning for being slow, which
was the only time he was ever out of humor with me. He had
given me a fine horse the day before, and I told him I was trying
him to see if he was suitable for the trip; and that he was not
to be trusted, and I would, consequently, have to ride old Punch.</p>

<p>This horse, for his services, deserves especial mention, and I
will, therefore, describe him. He was a Spanish brown, fifteen
hands high, with black legs, mane and tail. He was no fancy
horse, but heavy and substantial, with a good honest trot, a fast
walk and never failing wind. I had drawn him at Camp Gurley,
and trained him to suit my purpose.</p>

<p>Near to the town of Fayetteville, in Lincoln county, Kentucky,
night overtook me, and I left the road a short distance and slept
in the woods. This was on Saturday night, and on Sunday
morning I rode into town. The citizens were astonished to see
a single man dressed in full Yankee costume&mdash;blue jacket, blue
blouse and blue pants&mdash;and armed with the well known Yankee
accoutrements, venture among them. They gathered about me
in a great crowd, and seemed to regard it as the freak of a madman;
but on approaching me at the hotel, they found me entirely
rational, cool, and of decent deportment, and they at once changed
their minds, and took me for one of their own men in disguise.
Seeing that it was my best plan to encourage this belief, I ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
my breakfast, went to the stable to see my horse fed, and then
returned to my room at the hotel. There were about three
hundred men gathered on the sidewalk to ascertain what the
strange arrival meant, and to hear the news; and they were
watching me with eager interest. I felt that I was playing a
delicate game, with my neck in a halter. If they had only
known my true character, they would but too gladly have hanged
me to the nearest tree. They asked me my name, which I told
them; next my regiment, and with a swaggering air, I said:</p>

<p>"The 4th Ohio Cavalry."</p>

<p>"What is your Colonel's name?" said one.</p>

<p>"Colonel John Kennett," I answered, slowly, and with a dubious
look.</p>

<p>"What is your Captain's name?" inquired another.</p>

<p>"Captain O. P. Robie," I told him.</p>

<p>"Where is your command?" asked one who appeared to be a
man of consequence.</p>

<p>"At Shelbyville."</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "if your command is there, what are
you doing here by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," I responded, "if you want to know, I came to
demand the surrender of this town."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the man; "that is too good. One man to
take a town like this," and they enjoyed the joke hugely.</p>

<p>They now began to look exceedingly wise; and I heard the
whisper pass from mouth to mouth, that I was one of Morgan's
men. This declaration I heard again and again, as I passed
through the crowd. Soon after, a gentleman stepped up to me
and requested to examine my gun, which I handed to him after
removing the cap; but I at the same time drew out my pistol,
cocked it, and held it in my hand till my piece was returned to
me. After a brief survey of the gun, it was delivered over to me
with trembling hand, when I restored the cap and put up my pistol.</p>

<p>At this moment I was called to breakfast, and walked into the
dining room and sat down to the table, keeping an eye on everything
at once. I seated myself beside a man of good appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
who had on a handsome uniform and the three stars of a rebel
Colonel. Slinging my carbine across my knees, with the hammer
up, ready for instant use, I loosed my pistols, in the scabbard
on one side, and a vicious bowie knife on the other, after
which I began to appease my appetite on the good things before
me, watching the Colonel closely. He looked at me three different
times, and then rising abruptly from the table, darted out
into the crowd, and I saw no more of him. A few minutes after,
I heard the people on the sidewalk raise a loud laugh at the expense
of some one.</p>

<p>After eating a meal&mdash;the first since I had left camp&mdash;I went
out into the crowd again, and called for the mayor, saying I
wanted him to surrender the town. Again the bystanders raised
a laugh, and called for some one to go for the mayor, as he was
not present. They then began to joke me about our gun-boats,
saying the Yankees would never fight unless backed by them.
I told them that General Mitchell had dry land gun-boats, with
steel soles and spring runners, and that he had used them with
great effect at Bowling Green. One of the men said:</p>

<p>"If you're a Yankee, show us a Yankee trick, and we will
believe you."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, "I will do my best to show you one, before
I leave this neck of timber."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" said one.</p>

<p>"Down the country," I replied.</p>

<p>"Look here, now," one of the fellows pursued, "you may as
well own up and tell us where the captain is."</p>

<p>"What captain?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Captain Morgan, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said I, slowly, "you have waked up the wrong
passenger. I belong to the 4th Ohio Cavalry;" and again the
laugh rung out at my preposterous assertion.</p>

<p>In obedience to directions, my horse was brought out, and it
was a favorable time to leave, as they were all in a good humor,
and I consequently mounted and took the road to Huntsville at
a gallop. Just as I passed the crowd one fellow sung out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on there, you haven't shown us that Yankee trick
yet."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time," said I, turning in my saddle to
watch their movements, "before I leave this section of the
country."</p>

<p>About five miles from Fayetteville, is a very noted highland
called Well's Hill, and on the top of it there is a fork in the
road, the left going directly south to Huntsville, and the right
to Athens and Decatur. On reaching this road I was in the act
of turning into it, when I looked across on still another road,
called the Meredian road, and discovered a train of wagons slowly
coming up the hill. I watched it, till I saw there was no
guard near, and then riding around till I met the first wagon, I
caused it to be drawn close along against the fence, and there
stopped; then the next two to be drawn close along side, thus
making an effectual barricade against any force which was
approaching from that direction. Next I seized the wagon
master, who was some distance in the rear of the train, and
shoved him and the drivers up into the fence corner, making one
of them turn the mules loose from the wagons. The loads were
covered with corn blades, and other forage, so one could not see
them, but the drivers told me that the wagons were loaded
with bacon.</p>

<p>After arranging things to my satisfaction, I produced a bunch
of matches, and fired the fodder, on the top of each of the
wagons, which were of the old fashioned curved bodies, Connestoga
pattern, each of which had on it four thousand pounds
of bacon.</p>

<p>The guns of the party all happened to be in the wagons, and
none of them had any side arms, except the wagon master, who
had something under his coat, that looked like a pistol; and as
he wore a belt, it is very probable he had one; and some of the
citizens, I know had, for I saw three or four of them; but I was
ready to shoot before they could recover from their surprise, so
that it would have been foolhardy for them to resist, as I
would certainly have killed the first man who made a motion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
draw a weapon. I made no attempt to take their side arms, as
I did not want to lose my advantage over them for an instant.
There were three good guns burned up in the wagons, one a double
barreled shot gun, and two old muskets.</p>

<p>When the flames shot up, several citizens came to the scene
of action, but I thrust them into the fence corner, along with the
wagon master and teamsters. As soon as the wagons were so
far destroyed, that they began to fall down, and I saw that it
would be impossible to save anything of the wreck, I made the
drivers mount the mules, and the wagon master his horse, and
taking them on the road to Fayetteville, I told them that I was
going to count one hundred; and that if, by that time, they were
not out of sight, I would shoot the last one of them within
range. I then began to count; "one" "two" "three," etc., very
deliberately, while they put spurs to their steeds, and in a brief
time they were beyond my ken, over the hills, toward Fayetteville,
to give the inhabitants an account of my Yankee trick.</p>

<p>Wheeling my horse, I put out once more for Decatur, but at
the same time inquiring the way to Athens, as if I intended to
go there. As I passed the burning wagons again, I told the
citizens standing around, that if they did not leave instanter, I
would shoot the last one of them, and they scattered like blackbirds.</p>

<p>About ten miles farther down the road, I heard the deep,
sonorous tones of a preacher, belaboring a sinful congregation.
He was evidently a devout believer in a terrible and endless
punishment for the wicked, for he was holding out to his
audience the fearful picture of a lost sinner in hell, making a
comparison between his condition, and that of Dives, who, he
asserted, was once in a similar state of sinfulness, while on
earth, and who eventually brought up in hell, and from whence he
expressed a strong desire to visit Abraham in his new abode;
adding that the wishes of the unfortunate Dives could not be complied
with for some geographical cause&mdash;something in the topography
of the country&mdash;a gulf in the way, I believe. Over this subject
he grew eloquent, and had probably got about to his "thirdly,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and the congregation were almost breathless with attention, when
it occurred to me that there might be soldiers in the church, and I
had better look after them; otherwise they might give me some
trouble. Riding up to the door, I made my horse enter about
half way, so that I could see every man in the house. As his
feet struck the floor of the church, with a loud banging sound,
the people were astonished to see a soldier under arms, riding
boldly in among them. Turning to the preacher, I inquired if
there were any southern soldiers in the house. The clergyman
was standing with his hand raised, as he was about to enforce
some point he had made, being the very picture of earnest
honesty, looking as if he believed every word that he had said.
When he saw me, his hand dropped, and he seemed as badly
frightened, as if the identical devil he had so vividly described
had appeared before him. He was almost overpowered with
fright, and supporting himself by the rough pulpit, he glanced at
the back door, and then faltered out: "Not now, I believe,
sir." I saw that there had been rebel soldiers there, and that
they had escaped in the direction of his glance; I instantly
pulled my horse back, and spurred to the corner of the log
church, just in time to see four men disappear in the brush
across a field which lay back of the building. They were too
far off for me to shoot at, and not desiring to disturb the
worship further than the strictest military necessity demanded,
I rode on, after desiring the clergyman to pray for the President
of the United States. The rebel papers had an account of the
affair, but they lied when they stated that I tried to make the
preacher take a drink of whisky; for I hadn't a drop to bless
myself with.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I met two soldiers riding leisurely along to
church. I halted them, demanded their names, regiments, and
companies, and informed them that they were prisoners of war;
that I was a federal soldier, but that there was no way for me to
dispose of them so far from our lines except one; I was sorry
it was so&mdash;but I must shoot them. They begged that I would
spare their lives, and pledged their honor that they would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
with me in good faith, if I would not kill them. I pretended to
be in a deep study for a few moments, and then told them if they
would take the oath of allegiance to the United States, I would
let them go; and to this they agreed eagerly.</p>

<p>Holding up my right hand, and removing my cap, they imitated
my example, uncovered their heads, raised their hands, and
with a solemn look, that would well become a court-room, waited
for me to administer "the oath." I had joked them far enough,
however, and not wishing to be guilty of blasphemy by administering
an obligation I had no authority to require of them, I
told them that I would rely upon their honor, but they must do
nothing toward pursuing me, or giving information concerning
my whereabouts; and I then told them to "go in peace."</p>

<p>The next man I met was an old citizen, riding a very spirited
horse, and dressed in a suit of butternut-colored homespun.
Tall, thin featured, and gaunt, he was the very picture of a secesh
planter. I stopped him, and inquired the way to Camargo;
he pointed to the road he had just left, and told me to follow that.
I now told him I was a confederate officer, and that I had orders
from Gen. Beauregard to gather up all the stragglers I could
find, and bring them forthwith to Corinth; that we were expecting
a great battle there with our "detestable foe," the Yankees,
and that it was absolutely necessary for every one to be at his
post.</p>

<p>"You will," said I, "do me a favor and your country good
service by giving me the names of all soldiers who are at home
without leave in your neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," he replied; "I will do so with pleasure; and
if I had time," he added, "I would go with you, and help to find
them."</p>

<p>I then drew out a note-book, and wrote down each name he
gave me, with the company and regiment of each man, together
with his residence; and then asked him to refer me to some responsible
citizens, who would give assistance if necessary. He
gave me the names of half a dozen, who, he said, would not only
assist me, but would give the names of other delinquents.</p>

<p>He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
now prepared to ask me a few questions, and prefaced
them with the statement that he was the "Chief Justice of
Lincoln county," and that he was on his way to Fayetteville to
open court on Monday morning.</p>

<p>"Are there many cases to be disposed of?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good many," he said.</p>

<p>"What is their nature generally?" was my next inquiry.</p>

<p>"Why, they are mostly political," said he.</p>

<p>I was at no loss to know what the phrase meant; the accused
were Union men, who, true to their principles, had refused to
yield to the demands of the secessionists, but chose persecution
rather than dishonor. I then concluded to have a little fun out
of the old fellow, and render the persecuted loyalists what assistance
I could. But as I did not desire to kill him in cold blood,
I concluded to frighten him a little by way of punishment.
Pointing to the dense column of smoke that was rising from the
burning bacon, I said roughly:</p>

<p>"Look there, old man."</p>

<p>"Why, what in the name of God, does that mean?" inquired
he, raising his eyes in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," I responded, "it means that I am a United States
soldier, and I have just burned a rebel train up there, and am
now about to dispose of the Chief Justice of Lincoln county"&mdash;at
the same moment raising the hammer of my gun, and drawing
a bead on him.</p>

<p>"Great God! don't kill me, sir," he piteously pleaded;
"don't kill me."</p>

<p>"Look here, old man," said I savagely, "if I let you live, do
you think you will trouble Union men in this county again?"</p>

<p>"O, no, no, I will not."</p>

<p>"Won't bring 'em to trial?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I will not," he solemnly asserted; "I have been
compelled to enforce the law," he then began in extenuation,
when I interrupted him with,</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about enforcing the laws, you old reprobate,
or I will kill you in your tracks. Now, see here," I continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
"I will give you a chance for your life. This is a level
road, and a straight one; now, I will count one hundred and
fifty, and if you are not out of sight in that time, I shall kill
you, just as sure as God made little apples."</p>

<p>I gave the word, and began to count, and he darted off, like
an arrow, and was soon lost to my view in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Again taking the Athens road, I pushed on rapidly for some
time till I passed several houses, and then, reaching a shallow
creek, leading into the woods, I turned down it, so that the place
where I left the road could not be found. I traveled up byways
till near sunset, when I met with an old man, who had just
crossed the Athens road, and he told me that he had seen twelve
of Young's Tennessee Cavalry and fifteen mounted citizens after
a man, "who had been raising a disturbance up the country."
He said that I answered the description exactly, and that he
believed I was the man.</p>

<p>"You had better hide somewhere, till after dark," he advised
me; "for they are alarming the whole country wherever they
go."</p>

<p>I saw that he was a Union man, so I told him that if I
kept on riding they could better see and hear me, and perhaps
it would give them a chance to bushwhack me. I then told
him I wanted to find a sequestered spot, where I could leave my
horse, and have him taken care of till I could get him again;
and he told me of a very good Union man, who lived down in
the woods, away from any public road, and advised me to leave
my horse there; and he gave me such directions as would enable
me to find the place, which I reached in safety.</p>

<p>Leaving my horse, I took to the woods on foot, making direct
for Decatur, taking the sun for my guide. The second night
overtook me in the woods very near Madison depot, on
the railroad between Huntsville and Decatur. I had tried to
travel in the night, but was overtaken by a terrible storm, and
the darkness was so great that I could not find my way. Being
very tired, I slept soundly, with no other bed than the ground,
and no cover but my rubber Talma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>I awoke next morning just as it was beginning to get gray in
the east, and found I had lain down in a low piece of ground,
and the water had run under and around me, until it was about
four inches deep. I was cold and wet, and hungry as a wolf.
I made the railroad my guide after that, and passed through
Madison just as the citizens were beginning to stir about, and
I saw four or five rebel soldiers starting at that early hour
toward a saloon for their morning drinks. I soon discovered
that the railroad was the safest route I could travel, as there
were no houses near it, and I followed it till I reached a point
near Mooresville, where I stopped at the house of a Union man
for breakfast, or rather dinner, for it was about ten o'clock. He
took me for a rebel in disguise, sent there to try him and ascertain
his sentiments. He gave his name as Porter Bibb, and I
gave mine as Gabe Fitzhugh. I was trying to sound him and
he was trying to sound me. We spent about two hours in lying
to each other, to discover each the other's opinions, but had
mutually failed, and when we had commenced lamenting the
death of A. Sydney Johnson in the battle of Shiloh, we were
interrupted by the entrance of a Quartermaster's sergeant, who
I ascertained to belong to Young's 2d Tennessee Cavalry, and
that they were guarding the identical bridge I was sent to
inspect. I got into a conversation with them, and gave the 8th
Texas&mdash;Wharton's Rangers&mdash;as my regiment. They were
without suspicion, and I do not think they had ever seen a
Yankee before.</p>

<p>My first business was to get their confidence&mdash;the next, to
draw them into a conversation respecting the bridge. This
was done without exciting the least suspicion as to who I was.
They told me all about the bridge and its defenses, and how
they were built of cotton bales; and the sergeant gave me a
description of how they tried its qualities as a defensive work.</p>

<p>"We took a six pound gun," said he, "and planted it three
hundred yards from the fort, loaded with a heavy charge of
powder and a solid shot, and then aiming at the fort about
breast high to a man, we fired. The ball went through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
first wall and turned downward, and struck the ground, glanced
upward, struck and went through the top bale, knocking it to
pieces, turned downward again and hit the water about the
middle of the river, glanced up and struck a house on the
opposite side of the river, then went through the walls and fell
in the yard near the house."</p>

<p>"Why did not the officers make the fort stronger?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I asked that question myself, but the
Colonel said it wasn't intended to stand a siege, nor to turn
artillery, but merely as a protection against Yankee cavalry;
that the 4th Ohio was everywhere, and pitching into everything,
and no one knew what day they might come to this
section of the country. But let 'em come; we are fixed for
'em now."</p>

<p>He was so explicit in his description that he actually mapped
out the fortifications on the floor of Bibb's shop.</p>

<p>While we were talking a rebel Captain came in, who, I suppose,
was a relative of Bibb. He was very inquisitive, and
wanted to know all about me, adding that he hoped I would
take no offense at his questions, as these "were very suspicious
times."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," was my answer, "an honest man is never
afraid of being watched?"</p>

<p>"Is not that a Yankee uniform you are wearing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you wear it?" was the next inquiry.</p>

<p>"Because," said I, "it is unsafe to wear any other where
I have been."</p>

<p>"Where was that?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Near Shelbyville."</p>

<p>"How came you to be there? Why are you not with your
command?" was his next query.</p>

<p>"I was," said I calmly, "left behind at a house, on the
retreat from Nashville, too sick to travel."</p>

<p>"Whose house were you left at?" he persisted in asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was left with a man named Butler."</p>

<p>"Where is your horse?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I let a comrade have it," I told him, "because I was afraid
I would never be able to ride again."</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To my regiment."</p>

<p>"What is your regiment?"</p>

<p>"Wharton's Rangers."</p>

<p>"What is your Captain's name?" he would like to know.</p>

<p>"Captain Cook," I told him.</p>

<p>"What part of Texas were you from?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From Waco, on the Brazos river," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! I have been there; were you acquainted with Dr.
Tindsley?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said; "he is president of the vigilance committee
of McClennan county."</p>

<p>He then went on to ask a great many more questions about
the county and the people, and finally became fully satisfied that
I was all right, and a good soldier. He then took his leave, and
in a few minutes the corporal and sergeant got through their business
and departed. Bibb then told me that dinner had been
waiting for some time, and that he thought the men would never
get away.</p>

<p>"But," said he, "I never would have asked them to eat with
me, if they had staid till to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>I swallowed a hearty meal, the reader may be sure, as I had
not eaten since I left Fayetteville on Sunday morning, and this
was Monday noon; and, after dinner, I started out for Decatur,
still following the railroad. When I passed houses, it would be
so far off that I was not noticed; and when a train passed, I
would be standing behind something, so that those on board
could not see me until they had passed, when it would be too
late to either stop, or shoot, or do anything else. When I arrived
at the first railroad bridge in the swamp, not far from the
Y in the road, I came to the camp of the 2nd Tennessee. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
walked in, unconcernedly, and called for Colonel Young, but
was informed that he was over the river, at Decatur.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to see <i>him</i>, sir?" asked the Major.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, "but I will call again; what time do
you expect him back?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock, this evening," answered the Major.</p>

<p>"Then I will call to-morrow morning," I said, and turned to
go away.</p>

<p>At this point the Major began to evince anxiety as to who
and what I was, and I answered that I was on my way to rejoin
my regiment, at Corinth. This satisfied him, and he went into
his tent; but an idle soldier bawled out:</p>

<p>"Say, thar; what are you doin' in a Yankee uniform?"</p>

<p>"Why, I always like to wear the best I can get," said I, and
moved on.</p>

<p>No one pretended to stop me, although several asked me questions.
Just as I was leaving camp, some one hailed me, and
wanted to know where I was going. I told him to a house that
I pointed out in the distance, and that I intended to stay there
all night.</p>

<p>"You had better stay all night with us," he said; "we will
treat you to the best we've got."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," I said; "I have been sick for some time,
and prefer sleeping in a house when it is convenient."</p>

<p>"Don't blame you, sir," he responded; "I would do it myself,
if I could."</p>

<p>When I got to the house, I told the lady I was sick, and would
like to lay down awhile; and she invited me to rest on a bed
which was standing near the fire, and I had a short nap, when I
was aroused by the entrance of two men. Without moving, I
surveyed them unobserved, for they had not seen me yet; and
then I affected to be sound asleep, being well-concealed by a
blanket. They inquired for me, and said they desired to speak
with me. The woman pointed me out, and said I was a soldier,
that had just stopped there, and inquired if I was the man they
wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>They said they supposed I was, and inquired of the woman
who I represented myself to be; and she told them substantially
my story, which was the same as that I had told before. One
of them wanted to wake me up immediately, but the other said
that I should be allowed to sleep a little, while they warmed
themselves. The first man, however, could not brook delay, and
he walked up and shook me roughly, saying:</p>

<p>"Come, soldier, get up; we want to talk to you."</p>

<p>I got awake, finally, and without offering to get up, asked
them what they wanted, in a tone expressive of no pleasure at
their intrusion. They then began to question me as to who I
was, where I was going, what my regiment was, and so on: all
of which I answered promptly and carefully. Pausing a little,
one winked at the other, who nodded in return; then addressing
me, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, we want you to go to camp with us."</p>

<p>"I have been to your camp," said I, "and came from it, over
here to stay all night."</p>

<p>"Well," said the spokesman, "we want you to go back with
us."</p>

<p>"I do n't propose to go back there to-night," I responded.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "I think you will <i>have to go</i>."</p>

<p>They had not yet drawn their pistols, and, without giving them
time to do so, I seized my own, under the blanket, and jumped to
the floor, ready to fire.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "get out of this house, and do it quickly, or
I will shoot you."</p>

<p>They began at once to stammer apologies for their conduct,
but I shut them up:</p>

<p>"I treated you like gentleman," said I indignantly, "and you
have insulted me by your outrageous pertinacity, and I want
you to get out of my sight. I do n't allow any man to intrude
on me, while I am attending to my own business."</p>

<p>They saw that they could not draw their weapons without exposing
themselves to a shot, so they walked out of the house.
Knowing very well that they would go to camp and get more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
men, and then return, I began to study how I should proceed.
One thing was certain; I could not get to the bridge immediately,
for it was too strongly guarded; so, sitting down to the
table, as supper was announced, I made the people believe I was
not in the least disconcerted at what had passed; but, all the
time, I was studying how to beat the rebels next. I carefully
calculated the time it would require for them to ride to camp and
get a squad of men and ride back; and after eating I stood in the
door a moment, and then said to the woman that I guessed I would
go over to camp and see those fellows; that I didn't know what
was the matter with them; and that they must have thought that
I was a suspicious character; and the woman thought my plan a
good one, and I started out, going across a very large wheat field,
and then all around it, trying to find my way through the swamp,
to the river, calculating to steal a boat and float down under the
bridge.</p>

<p>I failed in this, however, and knowing that I had no time to
lose, I started back up the country to find our army. I took a
course by the stars, and traveled till late in the night, when I
heard the deep-mouthed baying of a hound behind me. I stopped
to listen a few minutes, and heard it repeated several times,
and then came a chorus, loud and strong, of several dogs.
Listening attentively, I knew by the sound, that they were following
my track. I was near a dense body of timber, and
darted into it, at the top of my speed, and did not run far, till
I found, to my great joy, I was plunged into a stream of water
waist deep.</p>

<p>I now felt confident of breaking the trail; so, wading across the
stream, I raised on the other bank, into a dark, shallow swamp of
considerable extent. Holding on my course by the stars, I wandered
for nearly an hour, when it became so dark and cloudy that
I could not see. I, however, kept on, till so thoroughly exhausted
that rest was a necessity; but still the swamp seemed interminable,
and the water was about waist deep. I was almost ready to
fall from fatigue, when I discovered a white spot on the surface
of the water. It is an old adage, that a "drowning man will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
catch at a straw," and it was true in my case. I pushed on, and
found it was a pile of new rails, rising above the water about
five inches, and I clambered upon it, and stretched myself out
to rest, and was soon in a deep sleep. I could still hear the
dogs occasionally, as I mounted the rail-pile, and was astonished
at it, for I thought I must have traveled ten or twelve
miles.</p>

<p>Next morning, I awoke chilled almost to death. I could
scarcely straighten myself up, I was so benumbed with cold.
I got down into the water, which, by contrast, actually appeared
warm; and I waded through it for almost half an hour, when I
reached dry land, in the rear of a plantation; and, looking across
a field, I could see the negroes just turning out to work. I immediately
slipped across to their quarters, and approaching a
gray-haired veteran, I told him I was a Yankee soldier, and
needed his assistance, and he replied that anything he could do,
would be done quickly and cheerfully. I told him I was hungry,
and he went in and brought out an ash-cake, and a very
large, thick slice of ham, and gave it to me, saying, he was
glad to be able to do something for "his people," adding:</p>

<p>"Massa, I allus calls you 'our people,'&mdash;God's people&mdash;'coz
I knows you wants to make de poor brack people free, and don't
want to keep dem down, crushed down like dumb beasts, and
make slaves of dem as long as dey live. God will take care ob
his soldiers, dat he will; and dem what gits killed in battle,
he takes right home to glory. Tank de Lord, for his mercy;
de day ob 'liberance is at han', wen do poor brack man kin hol'
up his hed, an' say I'ze a man, and not a beast. Tank de Lord,
tank de Lord, for bringin' de brave norden solders to fight our
battles, and make us free, like oder people, and de Lord bress
you, my son, an' I hope you git back to your own people, an'
not a har of your head be touched."</p>

<p>Had I listened a moment longer I must have shed tears, so
feelingly earnest, and with such deep sincerity were the old
man's words uttered. As I was in haste, I broke off here, and
taking a young negro with me, to show me the way through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
next swamp, I jumped over the fence, and was soon out of sight
in the thicket.</p>

<p>When I parted with the old man, he asked my name and regiment;
and the last words I heard him utter, as I pushed out on
my journey, were:</p>

<p>"Ole Jacob will pray to de Lord for you dis night; may de
Lord always keep you in his han'."</p>

<p>My guide seemed to be perfectly at home in the swamp, and
piloted the way for three miles over a string of logs, which
seemed to be arranged by accident, and not design, so as to
form a complete chain across it, so that we were landed on the
opposite side without wading a step. I now made my way
across that immense body of timbered land which lies between
Athens and Fayetteville, to a mill, on the road to Huntsville,
and seventeen miles north of that town, and found that our
army had encamped there on the previous night.</p>

<p>Every horse in the vicinity had been picked up by our men,
or I would have now confiscated one to overtake the command.
I, however, was compelled to go on foot, till I reached Meridianville,
where, as good luck would have it, I met a negro in a
buggy, who was driving a very fine horse, and I at once concluded
to ride, and make up for lost time. I accordingly concealed
myself until he got close to me, when I stopped him and
jumped into the buggy, and, turning it around, I was off&mdash;not
only with the horse, but with the negro, baggage, and buggy, all
of which were impressed into the service of the United States.</p>

<p>Putting the horse out to the top of his speed, I drove into
Huntsville just as the men were raising the headquarter tents.
I reported the condition of the country, down below, on both
sides of the river, as far as Tuscumbia, and that it was clear of
rebels with the exception of the 2nd Tennessee and 1st Louisiana&mdash;both
cavalry regiments; but it was impossible for me to
get to the bridge, and learned that the rebels had it already tarred,
and that pitch-pine was piled in it, ready to be fired at a moment's
notice.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIX.</i></h2>

<div class="center">CARRYING AN IMPORTANT DISPATCH TO GENERAL BUELL.</div>


<p>When Huntsville was captured, a great amount of rolling
stock fell into our hands; indeed so sudden was the blow struck,
that a train already fired up, was unable to escape. Upon
this latter, Colonel Turchin's command mounted and started
for Decatur, at once; and in two hours the town was in the
Colonel's possession, and the flag of the Republic waving over it&mdash;my
friends of the 2nd Tennessee Cavalry having a hard time
to save themselves; and some of them, who were out in pursuit
of me, on coming back, being unaware of the change, rode directly
into our camp, and were captured.</p>

<p>The occupation of Huntsville took place on the 11th day of
April, 1862; and the amount of public stores which fell into
our hands was immense. We likewise took about five hundred
prisoners; and in the telegraph office was found a dispatch from
General Beauregard, giving the strength of his force at Corinth;
together with his position; the disposition of the command;
the amount of supplies on hand; the number of reinforcements
required; and by what time they must be on the ground, or he
would be compelled to evacuate the place; and adding that if
that place fell into the hands of the enemy, the cause of the
South was lost. This dispatch was given to me in a few hours
after I got to Huntsville, and I was ordered to take my own
way to get the document to General Buell, at Corinth, but to
get it there without delay.</p>

<p>I saw the importance of the dispatch at once, and I mounted
my wild horse&mdash;the one the General gave me&mdash;and, as he handed
me the document, he told me that he had sent two other men
with copies, and expressed the fear that they would not get
through, as they were inexperienced in the country. "Now,"
said he, "I depend on your getting through with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned my horse down toward the Fayetteville road, and
put him out at a rapid gait. He was a large, thorough bred
animal, six years old, and perfectly wild, not even being "bridle
wise;" and, when once I got him started on a straight road, I
"let him out" to his best, till I got him pretty tired, when I
checked him up to a more moderate speed.</p>

<p>He made the trip to Fayetteville in three hours, a distance of
thirty-six miles. When I reached the town, I stopped with my
old friend, the tavern keeper, and got another good breakfast,
for I had been riding in the latter part of the night. Colonel
Pope, of the 15th Kentucky Infantry, was in command of the
town, and I went to him and asked him for a fresh horse. He
immediately summoned some of the leading citizens to his headquarters,
and told them they must furnish me with the best animal
in the town, and bring him to me forthwith; and they were
not long in obeying, but brought a magnificent horse&mdash;the property
of a doctor who lived near. The owner expressed some
dissatisfaction at parting with it, but a Yankee guard is inexorable
and it had to come; and Colonel Pope was a man who allowed
no trifling.</p>

<p>Mounting the doctor's horse, I went by way of Fishing
creek ford, to Columbia, the county seat of Maury county,
Tennessee, which place was commanded by General Negley;
and to him I delivered the dispatch, with the request of General
Mitchell that it might be sent immediately by telegraph to General
Buell, at Pittsburg Landing. General Negley was in bed
when I arrived at his quarters, but he rose and called on his Adjutant
General, Captain Hill, to take it to the telegraph office;
while he directed me to the best hotel in the place, offering to
pay my bill.</p>

<p>About four miles from Columbia, I had fallen from my horse
from fatigue alone, and I presume I lay for at least an hour, entirely
unconscious; but on recovering, I found my horse tied to
a bush near by; and in the vicinity was a woman's track in the
dust, showing that some one approached me, while in a state of
insensibility and had gone away immediately, supposing I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
merely sleeping; and it was probable that she tied my animal. It
was a lucky circumstance that none of the many squads of guerrillas
infesting that region, discovered me, in that unguarded
condition, or perhaps I would never have reached my destination.</p>

<p>I can not say exactly what caused me to fall; I remember
distinctly that I was wide awake and whistling at the time; when
suddenly it seemed as if a great weight was lowered down upon
my right shoulder, and I felt myself sinking; then suddenly
the weight seemed to shift to my left shoulder, and I remember
no more.</p>

<p>On my way back to Huntsville, and about eight miles from
Columbia, a negro waved his hat at me, and I stopped. He was
more than a quarter of a mile from the road, but when he saw
me halt, he came up at a run. He then asked me, almost breathless
with excitement, if I was the man that had gone up the
road two days before, and I told him that I did pass there
about that time, "the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, den," said he, "you bin de bery man dat I want to
see. Massa, I'ze gwine to tell you sumthin' now, but you mus'
promise neber to git me into no trouble."</p>

<p>I told him to speak out; that I was a Yankee soldier and his
friend, who would never betray him, and he then proceeded with
his information, which was to the effect that his master and eight
other men were waylaying me in a small mill, intending to kill
me, as I went down the country. He said that the plan was
laid in his master's house, and that he was the owner of the
mill; and that the other men were to come there, as if on business,
but bring arms with them, concealed. There was a bridge
above the mill, within short gunshot, and a ford below it, even a
less distance away. They were to stand in the mill and fire on
me; and if I went by the bridge, my body was to be sunk in the
pond, and if I crossed at the ford, my remains would be swept
away by the current; while my horse was to be given to one of
the party, who was going to the rebel army.</p>

<p>When I received this notice, I thanked my informant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
then rode down to the mill at a charge; and instead of going to
the bridge or the ford, dashed right up to the door of the building.
The miller saw me coming, and ran in; but I called him
out, and, keeping him between the mill and myself, took him to
account about the proposed murder. At first he attempted to
deny all knowledge of the offense; but I told him it was useless;
that one of the best proofs in the world was his running from
me, when I had not yet turned toward him. I told him that I
did not want to kill as old a man as he was, but if he did not
tell me all about it, I would go back to Columbia, and get a
party of cavalry and come out and burn his mill, his house and
barn, and carry off every dollar's worth of property he had,
that we could haul away. He hesitated a little, and then asked
if I intended to hurt him if he did tell.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "but I must know where your men are, for I
have come for a fight."</p>

<p>"They are not here at all, sir," said he; "they have gone;
they only staid one night and day, and then gave up your coming
back this way;" and he said this in such a way as to convince
me that he wanted it to go a long way in extenuation of
the act.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," I replied, "I will advise you a little. Never,
as long as you live, offer again to molest a Yankee soldier.
Nothing but your gray hairs now saves you from a bloody
death. Let this be a warning to you, and I will spare you;
but you must give me the names of those other men. I will
bring them to an account."</p>

<p>As he gave the names, I wrote them down on a slip of paper,
and then giving the hardened old sinner a parting admonition, I
crossed the ford, and resumed my journey.</p>

<p>Not far from Meridian, a little while before night, I overtook
Sergeant&mdash;now Captain&mdash;White, of the 4th Ohio. I was very
much fatigued and sick, and we stopped to stay all night near
where we came together. Our host was named D&mdash;&mdash;n, who is
a prosperous citizen, and to him I mentioned the fact that I was
not well. He stated that he was scarce of bed-room, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
I could sleep in the store-room with his clerk; while he put the
sergeant to sleep with a safe guard named Greathouse.</p>

<p>Late in the night I heard a noise outside, on the ground. It
appeared like some one walking softly on a loose board; and
listening, I heard it repeated; and at the same moment, the
figure of a man's head was visible before the window, and presently
another was seen; after which they suddenly disappeared.
Soon afterward, however, they returned, one at a time, and I
cautiously whispered to my companion, who, to my astonishment,
was wide awake and watching the window. I told him to slip
out cautiously into the other room, which he did; but as he went
he stumbled against a chair, and the figures disappeared instantly.</p>

<p>For a long time I saw no more, and was on the point of calling
the young man back, when they slowly approached from
opposite sides of the window. Soon the one on the left moved
noiselessly over to the right, and another appeared in his place;
and all stood gazing intently into the darkened room. I could
see them distinctly, but they could not well see me. At length
the last man who came up, raised a large, heavy gun, in such a
position that it crossed the window diagonally; and while this
was going on, I had quietly raised myself up in the bed, and
as I was not undressed, I drew my pistol and cocked it noiselessly,
by keeping my finger pressed on the trigger; and while the man
with the gun was gazing intently into the room, I fired with a
careful aim directly at his face.</p>

<p>There was a fall, a low moan, short, heavy breathing, hurried
whisperings, and then a heavy shuffling sound, as of men running
and supporting a considerable weight. My first impulse was to
spring out, and by firing rapidly upon the retreating party, rouse
my two comrades; but upon reflection, I concluded to hold my
position, as they were probably watching the door to shoot me
if I went out. I then waited till the moaning sound had died
away, and then whispered to my comrade to return to bed. He
did so, and we both enjoyed an unbroken rest till morning.</p>

<p>I never was able fully to explain this mysterious intrusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The men may not have been enemies; I may have misjudged
their character; but in all cases, when mistakes are made which
result in shooting, <i>I want to be the party who makes the mistake</i>.</p>

<p>I arrived in Huntsville again without further adventure, but
greatly fatigued. But there is an old adage that there is "no
rest for the wicked," and I found it so in my case. I went
at once to headquarters to report. Although it was night, I
found the General, as usual, wide awake and busy. Turning to
me quickly, he asked me if I was not "almost tired to death."
I told him I was very tired, but was ready for any service; to
go anywhere, or do anything he might desire, in the line of
my duty.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XX.</i></h2>

<div class="center">RECONNOITERING BRIDGEPORT&mdash;TAKEN PRISONER&mdash;MY TREATMENT&mdash;CRUELTY
OF THE REBELS.</div>


<p>After I had made my report, the General turned to me and
said:</p>

<p>"How many rebels are there at Bridgeport?"</p>

<p>I told him I did not know, but would go and see for him.</p>

<p>"That is just what I want you to do," he remarked; "go and
see. But do you want any money, or disguise?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I will go in uniform."</p>

<p>"Then," he continued, "I want you to use all diligence, and
report as soon as possible; you will find our troops at Bellefonte,
and then you will have seventeen or eighteen miles to scout
alone; do this for me now, and when you return, you shall have
a long rest."</p>

<p>I mounted my wild horse again, and was off at once. I had
time to get to Maysville, a town twelve miles out, before morning,
and there I stopped for breakfast. While I was staying there
I was overtaken by Lieutenant Criss, of the 4th Ohio Cavalry,
with about thirty men, who were going to Bellefonte, which is
about ninety miles from Huntsville. We had no adventure on
the route; but when we reached the place, we were surprised to
find that it had been evacuated by our troops. Lieutenant Criss
said that he must go back, as he had already gone further than
he was ordered; and he turned toward Huntsville immediately.
I dismounted, and as my horse could be of no further service, I
sent him back to camp by one of the men. I was now alone,
and nearly one hundred miles from our lines, and the little party
which came with me was rapidly disappearing from view.</p>

<p>When they were out of sight, I walked into a little grocery to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
see what was in it and to hear the news. The room was literally
packed with men&mdash;some dressed as citizens, but by far the greater
number sporting the tawdry trappings of the rebel soldier. I
scanned the crowd closely for arms, but could detect none.
What the men were there for I could not tell, nor did I stay to
inquire. My eye fell upon the landlord of the hotel, and I "saddled"
him for a dinner, but he refused to get it, telling me it was
after the usual time. I replied that I must have a meal, and that
immediately; and he again began to make an excuse in return,
and in an under tone muttered: "I do n't keep tavern to feed
Yankee soldiers at," when I drew my pistol and told him to get
out of that grocery and order my dinner at once, or he would be
a dead man; and I was about to suit the action to the word when
he darted out.</p>

<p>I then began to question the crowd to know how so many men
should collect together in so short a time after the Yankees had
left, but no one answered me. I knew that they were furloughed
rebels, and professional bushwhackers by their appearance, and
that they had just come down from the mountains, when they
saw our men leave, in order to see what it meant. What they
had done with their arms, or why they were unarmed, was a
mystery to me. Their frightened appearance showed that they
had just huddled into the little grocery when they saw our squad
approaching; and nothing prevented their capture, in a body,
but the fact that Lieutenant Criss had failed to search the town
before he turned back.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the tavern keeper appeared at the door and
invited me to dinner, which I found to be a very good repast,
though it was cold. Some people would scarcely have relished a
meal given under such circumstances, by an unwilling host, and it
prepared behind their backs; but I never feared "pizen," and
ate with a relish. While I was eating, a train whistled in the
distance, and in a minute it dashed into town.</p>

<p>The crowd rushed out, and off into the mountains, at the first
sound of the whistle; and I was happy to be thus suddenly relieved
of my ill-looking neighbors. The train was loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
troops, under command of the Lieut. Colonel of the Thirty-third
Ohio infantry, and Major Driesbach, of the 4th Ohio cavalry.</p>

<p>The Major did not like to see me start out on foot, so, yielding
to his advice, I took a horse that he provided for me. I did
this against my better judgment, for I very well knew that I
could not ride two days without detection. The Major then
sent a detachment of men with me as far as Stevenson, under
command of Capt. Crane, and on the route we were continually
beset by high waters, which overflowed large sections of the
country. It was dangerous to travel through the swamps, for it
was impossible to know the moment we might be precipitated
over a bank, into deep water, or the channel of a stream, so
swift that it would carry us away in the current. However,
after great labor, and several "duckings," we found ourselves
in Stevenson, a little town in the Cumberland mountains, where
the Memphis and Charleston railroad crosses the railway from
Nashville to Chattanooga; and here we stopped at the "Alabama
House," then a very good hotel. There was no enemy
nearer than Bridgeport, which was ten miles away; and as it
was my business to reconnoitre that town, and ascertain the
strength of the garrison defending it, Capt. Crane retired from
Stevenson to a post three miles out, and encamped, to await my
return. I was favored by the darkness, and rode along the main
road, while the rebels were extremely careless, not anticipating
the presence of an enemy. As I approached the camp, I
stopped a big booby of a boy, who had not sense enough to
know one kind of soldier from another, and got him to tell me
where the pickets stood, and all about the lay of the camp,
which he could not help knowing, as he had just been there, and
was on his way home; and he also gave me a very close
estimate as to the force the rebels had in and around the place;
and he further pointed out a railroad bridge across Widow's
creek, which the enemy were rebuilding, or rather had rebuilt,
but on the first trial the structure and locomotive were precipitated
into the stream together.</p>

<p>Bidding the boy good bye, I followed a road he described, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
after traveling about four miles, I rode into the rebel camp.
Up one way, and down another, I went swiftly, through the
dark, without being once halted or disturbed by a Johnny. If
they noticed me at all, they probably supposed me to be an
orderly.</p>

<p>Having thus a good opportunity to judge of the number of
their forces around me, I arrived at the conclusion that, on
the north side of the river, there were about five thousand men,
thus confirming the statement of a negro, who had visited us,
some time before, and who also estimated that there were about
three thousand on the south side. I saw two pieces of artillery
near the river bank, above the bridge, but these were all the
cannon I saw. Bridgeport was, as I discovered, a "flourishing
village," consisting of one house&mdash;a well built one story frame,
with two rooms.</p>

<p>Having reconnoitered to my satisfaction, I returned to Capt.
Crane's camp, reaching it a little before daylight, when I found
him in the act of starting again for Bellefonte. I gave him my
report to deliver to the General, telling him that I would remain
in the mountains, till our troops came up to take the place.</p>

<p>Parting from him, I climbed up into the mountain, with my
horse, taking a route which would lead me toward Bridgeport.
When I got to Widow's creek, again, I went down into the
valley, passing the picket at the railroad bridge, and passing
around by a ford, some distance below, and attempting to ride
again into their camp, in broad daylight. I had proceeded about
one hundred yards toward the camp, when I was halted by a
picket, consisting of a Sergeant, and eight men. When I turned,
they were standing at a "ready," and I saw that something must
be done quickly, or it was all over with me; so, quietly wheeling
my horse around, I made back toward them very quietly, and when
within about thirty-five yards of the post, raised my gun quickly,
leveled it at the Sergeant's breast, and fired; then spurring my
horse well back in the flank, I started him off with a spring.
I saw the Sergeant reel, but saw no more. At that instant they
fired, but missed so badly that I did not even hear the whistling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the balls. Again they drew a bead on me, but I threw myself
down on my horse's side, and went past them at a charge,
and the missiles went far over my head, and I was safe. They
had double barreled shot guns, and had each barrel loaded with
a ball, and three buck shot; this I learned afterward.</p>

<p>I had to run, through a straight lane, about eight hundred
yards; and while going down it, several bullets were fired, some
of which passed near me; so I concluded that there must have
been more rebs about than the eight at the picket post, though
I did not see them. When I got to the end of the lane, I
wheeled into the mountains, and for the first time looked back.
Here I saw a squad of cavalry, just entering the other end of
the lane.</p>

<p>When I got about half way up the mountain I had to dismount,
as my horse was now thoroughly exhausted. Stooping
down to take a drink of water at a spring, I distinctly heard the
rebs at the foot of the mountain, yelling to an old miller whom
I had passed, asking him which trail that bareheaded man had
taken. I at once hurried on up the mountain, and when on the
top, struck out on a path which rather led me back toward
Bridgeport&mdash;a piece of strategy intended to deceive my pursuers,
who would naturally conclude that I was heading for Bellefonte&mdash;something
I should have done, had my horse been
equal to a straight race. As it was, however, I had to rely on
woodcraft alone.</p>

<p>The main body of them missed me at the spring, but a few
held on the right trail, and we had it up and down five high
mountains, and across a many valleys, back and forth through
the different little trails, until we were overtaken by night. I
now began to think my escape certain, but on coming down into
the valley of Little Coon, I found every road picketed, and the
citizens aroused; and I heard of several squads of cavalry
scouring the country in search of me.</p>

<p>Some of the citizens were ready to befriend me, but others
were shy; while one, and only one, shot at me, and he stood at
least three hundred yards off, and as soon as he touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
trigger of his piece he wheeled and took to his heels, as if Old
Nick was after him. After dark I thought I would have time
to stop and get a bite to eat, as I was exceedingly wearied and
nearly famished; and I accordingly stopped at the house of a
man named Terry. He was moderately wealthy, but like a
great many others in that section and at that time, was not
bountifully supplied with provisions; but his daughter gave me
some corn bread and milk, together with some fried bacon; and
after eating what I wanted, I discovered that I was so exhausted
from over exertion, that it was next to impossible for me to
move. Rest was absolutely essential, and I threw myself down
before the fire, putting my feet as near to it as I could bear, in
order to take the soreness out of them.</p>

<p>I had been there, I presume, about half an hour when two
men entered, whom I supposed, judging from their appearance,
to be citizens; and our orders were to treat such with kindness,
and not molest them unless they showed signs of hostility; and
I accordingly used them politely when they entered. They told
Terry that they were greatly wearied, and desired to stop for a
while to rest; but they were scarcely seated, when a knock was
heard at the door, and when it was opened a soldier, in full uniform,
entered. In an instant I was on my feet, and clearing
the space between us at a bound, leveled my pistol on him. We
were but about two feet apart, and the muzzle of my weapon
touched his breast, and I ordered him to put down his gun; and
as he perceived no time was to be lost, he lowered his piece until
it nearly touched the floor. This was done in much less time
than it takes to tell it; but at this stage of affairs the other two
sprang at me with pistols in hand and jammed them violently
against my head on each side, and ordered me to surrender, and
at the same instant they seized hold of my pistol-hand, and
jerked it back over my head. Thus relieved, the soldier raised
his double-barreled gun, and thrust it against my breast, and
ordered me to surrender; and although further resistance was
useless, I did not and could not speak. I was completely taken
in, and it was all the result of my foolhardiness and carelessness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
I could have done without anything to eat, and I might have
abandoned my broken-down horse, which was, at best, but an
incumbrance to me; and I might have concealed myself in the
mountains till our army advanced on Bridgeport, which I very
well knew would be in a few days; indeed, there were many
things I could have done, and avoided my embarrassing situation;
but it was then too late; I was a prisoner.</p>

<p>I was taken from the house into the yard, when, for the first
time, I discovered that the place was surrounded. About two
hundred yards from the house was the captain of the gang, and
we marched out to him; he ordered me to be tied, and then I
learned that my captors belonged to Stearns' battalion of Tennessee
Cavalry.</p>

<p>The reader will be able to derive a faint idea of what I saw
and suffered, from this time till I was exchanged, from the following
report I made to Gen. Rosecrans, and which I extract
from the "Annals of the Army of the Cumberland," and which
was written just after I had been exchanged and had reported
to my regiment for duty:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right"><span class="smcap">Murfreesboro'</span>, March 22d, 1863.</div>

<p>"On the 24th of April, 1862, I was taken prisoner near the town of
Bridgeport, Tennessee, by a battalion of rebel cavalry under command of
a Colonel Stearns. I was alone on a scout at the time, and fell in with
nine of the enemy's pickets. I got the first shot and killed the sergeant,
(so I was told by Captain Poe, who had command of the pickets.) I was
pursued by five companies of cavalry. After running several miles I was
obliged to stop and dismount at a house to get something to eat, and
while there was surrounded by one of the pursuing companies and captured.
I was then tied on a horse and carried over a mountain to where
the battalion was camped; arriving there about nine o'clock P. M. When
we got there I was immediately surrounded by about two hundred men,
some crying "Hang him!" "Shoot him!" "Shoot the d&mdash;d Yankee!" and
several of them leveled their guns on me; some of them being cocked.
A Captain Haines told them I was his prisoner and under his protection,
and he detailed twenty-four men to guard me, placing two men at each
corner of my blanket. When we went to bed the Captain lay down on
one side of me, and his first Lieutenant on the other; and in this way I
was preserved from assassination.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>"The next day I was taken to Bridgeport. I fared very well at that
place, but the day following I was taken to Chattanooga and confined in
the jail, a two story building. The upper story, where I was confined,
was about twelve feet square. Here were confined nineteen Tennesseeans,
a negro, and myself. In the dungeon, which was only ten feet square,
were confined twenty-one men, belonging to the 2d, the 21st, and 33d Ohio
Infantry, who were charged with being <i>spies</i>. They were under command
of a Captain Andrews, who was then under sentence of death by a court
martial recently held at Chattanooga. They were waiting for the Secretary
of War at Richmond to ratify the proceedings of the court martial
previous to executing the Captain, and they said if they were ratified, the
rest would certainly be hung. I was afterward informed by the rebels
that Andrews and eight of the men were hung at Atlanta, Georgia. I
was told subsequently by a rebel citizen, that they hung Andrews and
seventeen men. I once went into the dungeon where these men were,
and found them handcuffed and chained in pairs by the neck with a heavy
chain, which was locked around each man's neck with a padlock that
would weigh two pounds. These padlocks were larger than a man's hand.
We were fed twice a day on tolerably good bread, spoiled beef, and coffee
made of cane seed. There was no sink in the jail, and our offal stood in
a bucket in the room where we were confined, day and night, and was only
emptied twice a day, and of course the stench was intolerable. We
were denied the privilege of washing our clothes, or of having it done.
The jail was literally swarming with vermin, nor was it ever cleaned out.</p>

<p>"From Chattanooga I was taken to Knoxville, to another jail, and confined
in an iron cage. Here I was told by a man named Fox, the jailor,
that I was brought to Knoxville to be tried by a court martial as a spy,
and that if I was tried I would no doubt be hung. This court martial
adjourned without bringing me to a trial, as did the one at Chattanooga.
From there I was sent to Mobile, where another court martial was in
session. After keeping me about eight days at this place, I was next sent
to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. From this city I was taken, in company with
all the other prisoners at this post, to Montgomery, Alabama. The first
day out I was taken sick with pneumonia and typhoid fever, but the rebel
surgeons refused me any medicine, and even a bed, and I was left for
twelve days lying upon the deck of the boat, with nothing to eat but corn
bread and beef, which latter the rebels said had been packed five years.
At Tuscaloosa they shot a federal soldier for looking out of a window,
and wounded another in the face for the same offense. At Montgomery
they refused to let me go to a hospital, although in an utterly helpless
condition. Here they shot a federal Lieutenant under the following circumstances:
he had been allowed to go out for milk, accompanied by a
guard, and he was waiting for a woman to hand the milk out through a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>window, when the guard gave the order to '<i>come on</i>.' 'Wait a moment,
till I get my milk,' said the Lieutenant. The guard made no reply, but
instantly shot him in the breast with a shot gun, killing him forthwith.</p>

<p>"From Montgomery I was taken to Macon, Georgia, in company with
twelve hundred others. Here we were allowed seven pounds of corn
meal and two and a half pounds of bacon of bad quality, for seven
days. We were allowed two surgeons and but very little medicine. Our
men fared very badly here, being punished severely for the slightest
offenses. One man, named Cora, was kept tied up for three days by the
wrists to a tree, so that his toes just touched the ground, because he
helped kill a yearling calf that got into the camp. A Floridan and two
Kentuckians, political prisoners, were confined in the jail at Macon on
quarter rations for twenty-two days. The only offense they had committed
was to attempt to escape from the prison lot. Our men were pegged down
on the ground for any misdemeanor. This was done by stretching out the
limbs and driving down a forked stick over them, and the operation was
completed by driving one down over the neck. It would be impossible to
tell all the hardships to which we were subjected, but I have endeavored
to portray a few of them. They may be summed up thus:</p>

<p>"We were confined in bad quarters, and many were without any
quarters. Our dead were left unburied for days together, and some
entirely so&mdash;at least to our knowledge. We were denied medical attendance.
Our chaplains were forbid preaching to us or praying with us, (by
order of Major Rylander.) Our men and officers were shot without cause.
An insane federal was shot at Macon, Georgia, for no offense. We were
compelled to bury our dead in the river banks, where their bodies were
liable to be washed out. We were beaten with clubs on board the steamer
en route for Montgomery, Alabama. We were fed on foul and unwholesome
diet, and frequently left without any rations for two or three days at
a time. Our exchange was delayed as long as possible, and we were confined
in camps surrounded by swamps, as the rebels said, that we all
might die. I find it impossible to enumerate all the hardships put upon
us, but have enumerated such as were the most intolerable."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While we were proceeding along through the mountains, we
came to a narrow shelf, with a deep abyss on our right, and a
perpendicular rocky ascent on our left; and along this I passed
watched by five guards&mdash;two before and three behind. At some
parts it was so narrow that it was almost impassable for one to
walk along; and at one place, we came to a rock which almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
blocked up the way. There was not room for a man to walk
squarely between the rock and the cliff, while on the outside, the
trail ran so close to the great precipice, that it was extremely
dangerous to attempt to follow it, even on foot.</p>

<p>When we reached this place I asked the guards to untie me,
so that I could keep my feet from being hurt by the rock.</p>

<p>"No," said the sergeant, in a rough way; "ride on and hold
your feet up."</p>

<p>"You forget, sergeant," said I, "that my feet are tied under
the horse, and that I can not raise them."</p>

<p>"Well, ride on," he replied in a tone of command, "or you
may fare worse."</p>

<p>"Let me ride on the outside of the rock, then," I requested,
"or my feet will be jammed against the rocks."</p>

<p>He now turned partly round in his saddle, and drawing his
pistol, said: "Look'ee here now, sir, you ride right through thar
whar I did, or I'll shoot you."</p>

<p>Seeing that expostulations were useless, I rode into the narrow
channel, although I saw I should be hurt. Turning to one
of the guard, I said:</p>

<p>"Guard, will you untie my feet till I get through this place?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, with a horrid oath, "we've got orders from
Colonel Stearnes to keep you tied till we get you to Bridgeport;
he says you are a mighty hard case, and he gave us orders to
shoot you if you didn't go along willingly, so you had better
ride in."</p>

<p>My right foot caught on the top of the rock in the trail, and
my left against the side of the cliff; and for about three steps
down the mountain the whole weight of the horse's fore parts
rested on my ankles by the rope under his belly. The torture
was excruciating, but acting on Indian principles, I uttered no
complaint. The horse lunged forward three times on his hind
feet, until he dragged my foot over the rock to the end of it,
when I was released, and the horse's fore feet came down to the
ground again. The rebels seemed to enjoy my sufferings, but
otherwise they treated me well enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>My imprisonment was not entirely without its sources of
amusement. Everything was not tragedy, but I was delighted
by occasional comedy. One circumstance, in particular, may be
worthy of a rehearsal. When they were taking me from the
Chattanooga jail to Knoxville, I was kept in the depot about an
hour, awaiting the departure of the train; and as was natural,
the citizens who were lounging around, had a great many questions
to ask me, and my answers gave them evident satisfaction.
Two young officers and a lawyer came up and engaged in a conversation
with me, and attempted to turn my arguments by ridiculing
my cause, being particularly severe on Yankee prowess.
I at once waived all further conversation by remarking that I had
taken them for gentlemen. They at once whirled away through
the crowd, exceedingly indignant, and I thought no more of the
matter, when in a short time in came Colonel Bibb, post commandant,
or provost marshal&mdash;I believe the latter, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Where is that Yankee? Where is the sergeant of the guard?"</p>

<p>"Here I am," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Mr. sergeant," added the Colonel, "if you allow the people
to talk to that man any more, I will put you in irons, sir;" and
then turning to me, with a fierce gesture, he fairly screamed;
"and you, sir, Mr. Yankee, if I hear another word out of you,
<i>I will put you in double irons</i>."</p>

<p>"Crack away, sir," was my response, "there is nobody afraid
but you."</p>

<p>He immediately whirled around, and left the depot, trembling
with rage; and I expected every minute to see a guard come in
with the irons; but the train was soon after ready and I was put
on board.</p>

<p>When I was in Ledbetter's camp, they put me under a guard
of eight men in Colonel Stearns' tent, as he was not in camp;
and while there, the Major of the battalion came to me and told
me that General Ledbetter would have me released and commissioned,
and put in command of a company of conscripted men if
I would renounce my cause, and take the oath of allegiance to
the Southern Confederacy; but I declined, telling him I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
rather be a private in the Union army than a Brigadier in theirs.
He then left me and did not renew the proposition.</p>

<p>Next morning I was turned over to the provost marshal, and
put in the guard tent, along with two other men who "wouldn't
soldier." The Johnnies crowded around to see me, sometimes
passing into the tent, past the guard, contrary to all order and
discipline. The Lieutenant of the guard, a fine portly fellow,
finding that it would do no harm to let them in, came and sat
down by me on my blanket, in the most social manner possible;
and we passed some time in friendly conversation, when an Indian
adjutant forced his way into the tent. He began to boast of
the prowess of the southern troops and decry the pluck of the
Yankees, affirming that the latter would not stand the bayonet.</p>

<p>"You are a liar, sir," I fairly shouted. He was on his feet
in an instant, as well as myself; he reaching for a pistol, while
I raised my fist to knock him down. At this juncture, however,
the lieutenant of the guard stepped between us, and taking
the adjutant by the collar with one hand, and the seat of the
pants with the other, raised him on one knee, and tossed him
headlong out of the tent; then turning to me, in a good natured
manner, he resumed his seat and the conversation.</p>

<p>The men asked me in the presence of this lieutenant how to
get to our lines, and I told them; and he then informed me that,
if I were only outside of their pickets, under his charge, he
could turn me loose, and go with me to our army, and deliver
himself up. He then remarked in a whisper: "I'll bet there
will not be less than fifty of our men leave this camp to-night,
and go to your lines."</p>

<p>While I was in this camp, the Major of Stearns' Battalion
told me that ten of his command had been detailed and sent
down to Steveson to arrest or shoot me, but that when they
started toward me, they became frightened, and came back on
the run. That same day I had shot a rebel near that place, but
whether or not he was one of the ten I do not know. He was
on the run and refused to stop, as I ordered him, and I shot
him while running, and he sprang as high as a man's head in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the air, and fell on his face, when I went back to them, and told
some citizens where he could be found.</p>

<p>While at the Chattanooga depot, and after Col. Bibb had threatened
the sergeant so severely, a stout, heavy man, of very pleasing
appearance, came in. He was clad in a plain suit of blue
homespun, without a single mark or strap to show military authority.
He walked past the guard without a word, apparently
in search of some one, and then suddenly turning toward me,
said: "Oh! this is that Yankee, is it?" and walked directly
to me and extended his hand in a most friendly manner.</p>

<p>The sergeant of the guard, without a word, ran at him, seized
him by the arms, and clasping both of them down to his sides
with the grip of a vice, he stooped under him, and threw him
clear across the railroad track. He did not touch the ground,
till he reached the opposite rail. The man then walked out of
the depot as quietly as he entered it, but did not utter a syllable.
After he had left, an officer on the platform said:</p>

<p>"Do you know who that man was?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," was the surly answer.</p>

<p>"It was Major General Ledbetter," said the officer.</p>

<p>The sergeant dropped his head a moment, when he looked up
in a resolute way, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care a cuss; I won't be punished for every
man's misdoin's."</p>

<p>While on the route to Knoxville, my guard was under the
charge of the very Indian who had been so unceremoniously
thrown out of the guard tent for insulting me; and he now exhibited
all that spirit of revenge inherent in his race. I was
subjected to every annoyance that his malice or his caprice
could invent, or he dare inflict. On my arrival at Knoxville, I
was put in an iron cage in the county jail, and fed twice a day,
on good bread and beef, and some seed coffee; and when taken
out, I was placed in charge of the Eufaula Light Artillery
from the State of Alabama, and taken to Mobile, and thence to
Tuscaloosa by railroad, and from there to Montgomery by river.</p>

<p>While at Selma, I was once more solicited to take charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a company of rebel cavalry; and was tendered the influence of
Gen. McTyre; the offer of the general being made through his
son, who was the lieutenant in charge of me.</p>

<p>It would scarcely interest the reader to give a more extended
account of our sufferings; and I will only add, that they were of
the most horrid character, and thousands upon thousands died
beneath their crushing weight. At Macon, I escaped in company
with Lieut. Ford, of the 8th Iowa infantry, but was recaptured
six days afterward, so weak and sick that I could
scarcely stand alone. Ford was only out one day, when he was
recaptured, having been run down by bloodhounds. When I
was recaptured, I was saved from punishment by the adjutant
of the battalion of guards; but the lieutenant was ironed, and
kept in that condition, till sent off to be exchanged.</p>

<p>While in prison, we owed much to the care and kindness of
Dr. Hezekiah Fisk, surgeon of the 8th Iowa infantry, who was
a prisoner with us.</p>

<p>We were sent off for exchange in October, 1862, going by
way of Savannah, Augusta, Columbia, Raleigh, Petersburg and
Richmond. On the trip we suffered fearfully; men were left
dead at nearly every station on the entire route. I finally
reached my destination safely, and, on the 18th of October, 1862,
was exchanged. The officers on the flag-of-truce boat, and especially
the surgeons, exerted themselves to their utmost, to save
the men; but a large number had suffered so much that human
skill was unavailing, and died before reaching Washington City.
For my part, I was reduced to a mere skeleton, and was sent to
the Cliffburn Hospital&mdash;an institution in the care of the Sisters
of Charity, and received every attention that could be bestowed,
until I became well once more.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">ARRIVAL OF WOUNDED FROM FREDERICKSBURG.</div>


<p>A short time after I was taken to Cliffburne hospital, the battle
of Fredericksburg was fought, and thousands of wounded
were sent to Washington, to the different hospitals. Cliffburne
received its full share, and the Sisters had all that they could
attend to. They had but few sick men in their care, at that
time, their patients being generally wounded men. There were
men with legs off; men with arms off; men with, I might almost
say, their heads off; at least, they were minus a large part
of them. The wounds were made by every kind of missile known
to the science of gunnery, as well as saber cuts, and bayonet
thrusts. There were patients who had suffered two and even
three, amputations, and these wounded men represented almost
every State in the Union; indeed, I might say, every nation of
the earth. There were Americans, Irishmen, Germans, Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Italians, Austrians, and I believe Danes and
Norwegians; but they were all groaning under grievous wounds&mdash;suffering
in a common cause; all were Yankees now. There
were men there, who had scarcely been in the country long
enough to know how to ask for a drink of water in English; yet
whose first act on landing in America, was to volunteer in the
United States Army, to battle for the maintenance of the Government
that had always been an "asylum for the oppressed of
all nations;" and whose first initiation into the American service,
was to be hurried into a terrible battle, and stricken down
in death or with painful wounds, to pine away months of patient
suffering in hospitals. But all that I saw here bore their sufferings
with heroic fortitude. The wounded veterans would spend
their time in telling stories of battles and adventures; in reading
books and papers left for them by charitable or religious persons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in dressing their own wounds, if they were able; or in
recounting the circumstances under which they received them.
Letters from home formed their greatest solace. When one got
a letter from home, he would appear like a new man&mdash;it would
make him so cheerful. It was astonishing with what devotion
the Sisters would nurse, and watch over them. Here, in this
bunk, would be a patient, feeble little boy&mdash;a drummer, perhaps,
who had left his mother and sisters to join the army, and by the
stirring notes of his drum, to cheer the war-worn soldier, now
stretched on a bed of suffering, with no mother near to nurse or
care for him&mdash;perhaps, even she did not know where her darling
was; but he was faring just as well as he would with her,
for the Sisters of Charity were hovering over and nursing him,
supplying every want, and soothing, as far as possible, every
pain; there, in that bunk, is a brawny man, wounded by a
shell; his injuries are terrible; perhaps he is fearfully wicked,
and as he writhes in pain, upon his bunk, cursing his cruel fate,
at every breath, a Sister's hand smooths down his hardened pillow,
and a Sister's voice speaks words of comfort to his soul.
Perhaps she is repelled with fearful oaths&mdash;but only to return
to him when he is calmer, with redoubled kindness. Here, in
this ward, is a poor soldier dying. All their loving labors and
pious prayers have been in vain; the hand of death is on their
patient. Perhaps they have watched and cared for months
over him, and have had great hopes of his recovery; but now,
alas! they are called upon to perform the last kind offices for
him, and consign him to the grave. It is a sad trial to them;
and as they cluster around the dying man, they tell him of a
better world, and their prayers ascend to the throne of grace, for
the welfare of his soul.</p>

<p>For weeks, they watched my almost hopeless case; for some
of the Surgeons said I would die; but under their kind treatment,
I rapidly recovered, and was soon able to travel and
wanted to go to my regiment; but to pass through the "Government
mill,"&mdash;would be quite enough to kill me in my weak
condition, so I applied for a special order.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">AT HOME&mdash;FRENCH LEAVE.</div>


<p>By the aid of Hon. C. A. White, General Wadsworth, and
General Martindale, I obtained permission to leave Washington,
and go to Camp Chase, near Columbus, where my company was
on parole, for they had been captured on the day that I was exchanged&mdash;and
while at Columbus I took "French furlough," and
made a visit to my home, where I had a pleasant stay; but took
care to report at Camp Chase on "pay day." I was still very
weak, but improved rapidly, from the time I next "struck" hard
tack.</p>

<p>The Surgeon, in Washington, offered me a discharge, if I
wanted it, telling me I would never be able to do any duty
again. I refused him, telling him I would soon get well, and go
to the field again; and I lived to verify my word, for I have
done an immense amount of hard service since then. I went to
the field again with my company, some time in March, 1863.
Our route lay by way of the Ohio and Cumberland rivers; and
as we landed and remained at the little town of Dover, for some
time, I had an excellent opportunity to survey the old battlefield
of Donaldson. The ground was rough and hilly, and exceedingly
difficult to maneuver troops on; while the fort itself
stood on a commanding eminence overlooking the river. The
field was strewn with missiles of all kinds, while the dismounted
guns, the scarred and fallen trees, and the furrowed earth, all
told the terrific struggle that had taken place upon the hills.</p>

<p>Having no guide, I could learn nothing save what was then
discernable&mdash;such as the respective lines of battle of the two
armies. Here and there, along the interval between them, would
be places where the timber was unusually cut up, and the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
terribly torn by artillery, while every visible object on the surface
would be riddled with bullets&mdash;so many mementoes of violent
charges under a murderous fire. When we consider the
almost impregnable position of the enemy, fortified at nearly
every assailable point with extreme care and skillful judgment,
the nature of the ground our troops were compelled to charge
over, the battle of Fort Donnelson must appear to every reader
of history, as one of the most gallant victories which our troops
have won during the late long and bloody war.</p>

<p>In due course of time we arrived at Nashville, and, on landing,
set out for Camp Stanley, near Murfreesboro; and there we
found our regiment&mdash;the glorious old 4th&mdash;sadly thinned in
numbers, but as full of fight, and as enthusiastic in the cause as
ever. I missed many a familiar face, and many a voice that
would have given me a friendly greeting, had it not been hushed
in death. My comrades gathered around me, and welcomed me
among them once more; and now, again, I really felt at home.
No one knows the deep attachment existing among soldiers; they
can scarcely realize it themselves, until surrounded by adversity;
then it is that we <i>feel</i> how devotedly we love one another.</p>

<p>Company A had not been long in camp before it was put on
picket; and on this duty we continued for fourteen days under
command of Lieut. Charles D. Henry, being stationed on the
East Liberty pike, about two miles from Murfreesboro. For
several days nothing occurred to mar the even tenor of camp
life, except that a squad of bushwhackers, five or six in number,
fired a few random shots at us, which resulted in a quick chase
and a final escape.</p>

<p>After this the Lieutenant put me on patrol duty, outside the
lines, to watch all suspicious points; and while on this duty I
was one day joined by Lieut. Frank Robie, the Captain's brother.
We rode out together much beyond my ordinary trips, having
crossed Cripple creek, and gone about three miles beyond it,
when we met an old black man riding along the road, apparently
buried in deep thought. There appeared to be a feeling of calm
felicity pervading his soul, for it shone out in his face. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
were his meditations that he did not notice us till we addressed
him:</p>

<p>"Uncle," I asked, after saying how dee? "ain't you a preacher?"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes, and seeing only a strange officer and soldier
at his side, opened them wide and replied:</p>

<p>"La, massa, how did you know dat?"</p>

<p>"We only guessed at it; but what is the news?"</p>

<p>"Well, marsters," he said, "if I ain't mistaken, you is some
dem gemmen dey call Yankees, and if you is, I ain't afeard to
talk to you; but, Lor', a body doesn't nebber know who dey is
talkin' to now-days."</p>

<p>"You are right," we responded; "we are Yankees, and if you
know anything about the rebs, we want you to post us."</p>

<p>"Well, marster, I is de widder Trimble's Willis, an' I <i>is</i> a
preacher, a Methodist preacher, and last winter, on de fust day
of December, our soldiers cotch me an' whipped me, kase dere
was one of our boys on the plantation tole 'em dat de widder
Trimble's Willis prayed for de Union."</p>

<p>Of course we sympathized with the old man in his persecution,
but he was not the only one who was persecuted then for
opinion sake. He then proceeded with "Marster, it jes seems
to me that you Northern men knows ebery ting, an' you don't
seem to be afeard of nuthin'; why our men would no more
think ob ridin' so fur frum dere camps dan nuthin' in de world;
but gemmen, you is in a great deal ob danger here. You is
mity close to a big company of <i>our</i> men, an' you better be
keerful, for dey mout do ye harm."</p>

<p>I asked the old man how far off they were and which way.
He told me very explicitly that they were near a little town
called Milton, close by. I told the Lieutenant that I would go
and see where they were. He went back to the picket post,
while I thanked the old preacher and left him. For awhile
I wandered around through the brakes and over the hills,
passed through the town of Milton, but still saw nothing of the
rebels. After hunting in vain for some signs of them, I looked
all around for smoke, but none was to be seen in the timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
or any place where it was likely that any considerable number
should hide. The old darkey had reported them at nine hundred,
but added that it was only hearsay with him. I now
turned off all the public routes and went to searching the byways,
and taking one of these by-roads that led through the
farms, I made for a little, low gap in the hills, which here rose
almost to the grandeur of mountains. As I approached the
gap I discovered two men, one standing on the ground, the
other seated on his horse. They seemed at a loss to account for
me coming on perfectly unconcerned toward them. They
suffered me to approach within about forty steps, when the one
that was mounted wheeled his horse, and aimed to run off down
the opposite side of the gap, but I halted him twice and then
fired. The shot took effect between the shoulders, just to the
left of the backbone. He yelled murder twice in a terrified
voice, and then fell forward on his horse's withers, while the
frightened animal rushed madly down the hill. My whole
attention was instantly devoted to the other man, who was
mounting and preparing to follow his comrade's example. I
was afraid he would shoot me while I was reloading my gun,
which was a Smith &amp; Wesson carbine, but he was too badly
scared; he never stopped, but went down the hill at a break
neck pace. I ran to the top of the hill, and behold&mdash;just at
the foot of it were about one hundred and fifty rebels, who had
been, as I afterward learned, foraging. They were somewhat
scattered, for when I got my first view of them, they were
running from every direction for their horses, which were standing
in a bunch under a strong guard, right where two roads
crossed. For this point my second man was running. Just as
he got to it I fired, he being about one hundred and twenty-five
yards off when I did so, and without looking to see what damage
I had done, I turned in my saddle and called out, "<i>Forward
the 4th!</i> <span class="smcap">forward the 4th Ohio!</span>" then turning upon
the enemy again, I drew my pistol and tried it three times, but
every cap was wet. I then attempted to load my carbine a
third time, but it got out of fix about the trigger works, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
could do nothing with it. All this time the rebels were mounting,
and each fellow as he gained his saddle took the road for
Auburn without stopping to look back. A few stopped long
enough to discharge their guns, so that there were perhaps
fifteen shots fired at me, some of which cut very close, but did
no damage. One fellow, braver than the rest, walked right out
in the middle of the road and raised his gun to his face, took a
long, careful aim, and pulled the trigger, but the gun missed fire;
the cap bursted clear and loud, but I suppose the powder was
damp. He broke for his horse then as fast as his legs would
take him. I thought it was very questionable whether my
friends would ever hear from me again when I saw him taking
such deliberate aim at such close quarters, as we were so near
together that I could have counted the buttons on his coat. I
waited till they all got well started down the road, which was in
a surprisingly short space of time, and wheeled my horse and
took the road for Murfreesboro, and there is no mistake about it,
I rode rapidly.</p>

<p>As I passed the next house, I saw a woman standing in the
porch, watching my actions all the time; but she could not see
the enemy from where she stood. I told her to tell the rebels,
when they returned, that there was but one man in the attacking
party, and that he said he had flogged one hundred and fifty of
them, and could do it again.</p>

<p>This fight, if fight it might be called, took place at Hooper's
Tanyard, two miles from Milton; and on my retreat, I passed
through the latter place. Stopping a moment, I called a man to
me, and gave him the same message I gave to the woman, and
as I expected pursuit, I made for Murfreesboro, at once, which
was fourteen miles distant. However, I saw no more of that
party, though I did see another squad of twenty-six, that did
appear as if they were after somebody. The fear of a pursuit
by the first party, gave me a good speed; and the sight of a
second, caused me to persevere, until I was once more safe within
our lines.</p>

<p>I knew no more about the affair at that time, than what is contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in the particulars I have related; but a party of our cavalry
soon afterward went out in that vicinity, to scout, and there
learned that my first shot had killed a picket, and mortally
wounded a horse; and that my second had wounded a man
severely, and passed through the neck of one horse, and subsequently
wounded a second one; and that the enemy had went
to the town of Auburn, seven miles distant, without halting,
or breaking their gait; and that they deserted a large forage
train, which I could have destroyed, had I known where to look
for it; but it was behind a projection of the hill. Lieut. Henry,
of Co. A, was out on a scout, in the same direction, shortly
afterward, and the same particulars were learned by him. He
had a talk with the woman I saw, and she told him that she had
communicated my message to the men, and that one of them
exclaimed: "<i>Oh, he is a liar, there were but eighty-four of us</i>."</p>

<p>It was big enough, the way he told it; but I must still adhere
to my original statement, although I could only judge of the
number by the ground they covered, after they got closed up.</p>

<p>My next adventure was in Breckenridge's lines, at Dry Hollow,
not far from Bradyville. I got inside of his pickets, and
was taken suddenly sick, and was prostrate a couple of days,
before I could get out. I think, however, that hunger cured me,
if anything did, for when nearly famished I was able to travel.
I was only sent to see if he was still at his old place, in force,
or if he had skedaddled, and was only making a show of holding
the position. I succeeded in getting the desired information,
and in the darkest part of the night, got out of his camp again,
and made for Gen. Hazen's camp, near Readyville. On the way,
I stopped at a house near the Readyville and Woodbury road,
very much fatigued, and also exceedingly ill, and was waiting till
the people got me some breakfast. While laying before the fire,
I heard a rapid firing on the Woodbury road, and on going to the
door, I saw nine men of the Third Indiana cavalry, fighting with
more than thirty rebels. They were only three hundred yards
off, and I had no time to get closer, so I stepped behind a tree,
and commenced firing, with a Spencer rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The Johnnies held the Indianians very close for two or three
minutes, and at one time I thought they would all be captured&mdash;there
appearing no hope for them against such odds. I was still
unobserved by either party, and I therefore was enabled to use
my rifle expeditiously, and accurately. The Johnnies did not
discover where the cross fire came from, but when they found
bullets coming so rapidly, from another quarter, they wheeled
round, and fled in a hurry, several of them being badly hurt, as
I discovered from the way they rode. When the rebels left, the
Indiana boys put out for camp, taking with them several articles
I could see them pick up, although I could not ascertain what
they were, from where I was located.</p>

<p>The fight being over, I swallowed my breakfast in a hurry,
and took to the woods, fearing unpleasant consequences, and was
soon in Gen. Hazen's camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>




<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">SCOUT TO WOODBURY&mdash;PLAYING REBEL SENTINEL&mdash;NARROW ESCAPES.</div>


<p>When I got back to Murfreesboro it was necessary to know
how many rebels were at Woodbury, and I went from General
Rosecrans, under the direction of Captain Swaine, chief of scouts.
I left our lines at Readyville, and went a mile or more, when I got
an old woman to hide me in her house in a back room, where I
slept till the moon went down; and then taking up a branch of
Stone river, I slipped into the rebel lines without raising the
slightest alarm. It was only about seven miles by the high
road, but it was more than ten by way of the creek to my point
of destination. I kept constantly in the creek bottom, until I
was nearly opposite Woodbury, when I struck off to the hills
which surround the town, and from which a full view could be
had. I got to a good position on a hill, but could not see all that
was going on. I waited till day light, in the hope that I could
then see plainer; but I was disappointed in that, and at once resolved
to change my quarters to another hill. To do this, I had
to go down into a valley and walk across it, and then ascend the
other elevation, in plain view of the reserve picket. I had a
small glass, and was so near them that I could see the lint on
their coats very distinctly, and I discovered they were eyeing
me closely. I walked quickly out into the road, took a position,
and began to walk a beat, as though I was standing sentinel.
Presently a spruce looking old farmer came walking along, and
supposing himself inside the pickets, he moved carelessly, and
did not stop till the second "Halt," and an unmistakable motion
of my gun claimed his attention. He seemed very much surprised
to see a guard there, saying: "Nobody stopped me here
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I belong to a regiment which just came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
last night, and the officer of the guard put me on this beat and
told me to stop all persons going into the town unless they had
proper papers." He at once showed me a pass from John Morgan's
provost marshal, and I told him he was all right, and could
go on. He was highly tickled at the eulogies I bestowed upon
him, and before I let him go I managed to draw from him all
that he had seen in Morgan's camp on the day before.</p>

<p>When he left, I told him it was probable that I might be relieved
before he came back, but that he would find our camp
just over the hill there, and pointed in an opposite direction from
that I intended to go. I then resumed my walk upon the beat
for a minute or two, when I affected to see something suspicious
on the hill, which I started to go to, and raising my gun as
though I intended to fire, I aimed at a fancied object; then
lowering my piece, I pushed rapidly up, while the pickets
watched me intently.</p>

<p>When on the top of the hill, I stopped again, and looked intently
in the direction of the picket, and then passed around the
summit with my carbine raised, as though I expected to see the
object every instant; till, in a few minutes I turned the point
of the hill, so they could see me no more, when I ran along the
side for about half a mile; then climbing nearly to the top, I
doubled my track and ran back, till nearly opposite the picket
again; then getting down on my hands and knees, I crawled up
the hill cautiously, and concealed myself in a hollow log which
lay on the top.</p>

<p>I was now enabled to see the rebels in part of their encampment,
and everything that passed, either on the Readyville road,
or in Woodbury. It was very early in the morning of a tolerably
cold day when I got in the log, and by night I was nearly frozen.
During the day, I heard something running on the dry leaves
outside, and I immediately prepared for a defense, thinking, perhaps,
it might be a man who had seen me secrete myself. Suddenly,
however, it sprung lightly upon the log and dropped itself
through the opening right over my face; it was a coon, but it
saw the place was occupied, and politely withdrew. Possibly I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was intruding myself into its quarters, but as it did not wait to
demand any apologies, I offered none. It was large and fat, and
would have made a famous roast; but I had to lay still, for my
neighbors on the hill were vigilant, and had they seen me for a
second, they would have been after me with a sharp stick, which
they would have applied without mercy.</p>

<p>That night I left my log, and took the back track for Readyville.
I went across the country till I had passed the last of
their picket fires, of which there appeared to be several lines,
these being formed by Morgan's men, who was conscripting every
man he could find. I passed very close to some of the posts&mdash;so
near that I could hear the men talking in a low tone. At
one place I chased two soldiers out of an old log house, who were
inside talking to some females. As soon as I discovered they
were in there, I secreted myself behind the chimney, and began
"peeping" through the cracks. The fellows seemed to be on
very friendly terms with the old man and his three daughters,
the latter being very pretty, and at that time, putting on their
sweetest smiles. I felt a little anxious to change places with the
Johnnies about that time; or, if I had felt entirely assured that
they would not have became "unlawful," I would have been content
to talk to the odd girl; but that I knew was an impossibility,
and I dismissed the idea.</p>

<p>On the table sat a wooden tray filled with cakes, a few of
which I knew would do me an immense amount of good at that
time, for I was hungry; and I determined, if possible, to have
my fill. I, therefore, scrutinized the yard and out-buildings to
satisfy myself there were no other men there, and glanced
around to see if any picket fires were in that section; and finding
all was right, I walked off a few steps, and fired off my gun.
The Johnnies jumped out of the house, and as they did so, I
screamed: "Run, boys, run; the Yankees are on us!" and away
they went, as fast as their legs could carry them. I fired one
shot at them as they appeared in the yard, when the women
commenced shrieking fearfully, supposing themselves surrounded
by those horrid Yankees&mdash;the terror of all the chivalry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
South, male and female. I was so near the rebel pickets that I
dare not remain long for fear I would get myself into "business,"
so I put out for the low ground, and at three o'clock the
next morning was once more in our lines, where I slept till daylight;
after which I proceeded toward Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>When within about six miles of that town, I was walking
along the high-road, inside our lines, when I saw a party of eight
or ten men coming down from toward Murfreesboro. Thinking
they were our own soldiers, I trudged along, confidently expecting
a friendly chat when we met; but when they got nearer me,
I discovered they were partly dressed in gray. I, however, still
could not think they were other than Yankees&mdash;perhaps a detail
of scouts on some breakneck expedition&mdash;and I was still expecting
a friendly confab, when I noticed that they stealthily raised
their guns. That was enough for me, for I knew that they could
not mistake my character, as I was in full uniform, and under
arms; and I sprang through the cedar brake as fresh as if I had
just started out after a long rest; the sight of an enemy in
one's rear generally has a magical effect on the gait even of a
wearied man, and certainly it materially accelerated mine.</p>

<p>Running through the densest part of the brake, where they
could not follow me on horseback, I felt confident of escape, as
they could not see me before I saw them. I heard them crashing
through the bushes only for a short time, when I stopped,
after a mile heat in the cedars, exhausted. They were now
no longer in hearing, and I, therefore, rested myself awhile, and
then took a route through the brake, that I knew would bring
me out at old Jack Dill's, within four miles of Murfreesboro.
Jack was a fair specimen of a backwoods Tennessee Union
man; large, sun-browned, and muscular&mdash;honest and patriotic.
He invited me into the house with a hearty welcome, and told
me of a brush he had had with the rebels the day before; and
while the old man was recounting his adventures, his pretty
daughter Jennie set me out a nice dinner, with fresh butter and
new buttermilk, hot biscuits, and venison steak; and who could
not enjoy a story under <i>such</i> circumstances?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The rebels had thought to surprise him in his house, and drag
him off to the army; but old Jack was roused by the barking
of a faithful dog, and took to the brake near his house; and in
pursuing him, the rebels exposed themselves to his unerring
rifle, and went back unsuccessful&mdash;minus one of their men.</p>

<p>On returning to the house they vowed vengeance to his
daughter; she told them to go and make their threats to her
father himself; but they didn't go. Old Jack was very proud
of his gun&mdash;a long, full-stocked rifle. Patting it affectionately,
he said:</p>

<p>"You see she is so old and is worn so thin, that when I push a
bullet down her, she strains and swells out her sides, like a snake
swallowin' a toad; but, by hokey, I can knock the spots out of a
secesh yet."</p>

<p>From Dill's I took the main road to town, and in an hour I was
at headquarters making my report.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIV.</i></h2>

<div class="center">GEN. STANLEY'S GREAT RAID&mdash;PLAYING AID-DE-CAMP&mdash;SCOUTING AT HARPETH
SHOALS.</div>


<p>The next duty I was on was when Gen. D. S. Stanley, chief
of cavalry, made his dashing raid on the rebel camps near Middleton,
Tennessee. It was a brilliant affair, and managed with
consummate skill. Leaving Camp Stanley late in the evening,
about the last of March, or first of April, 1863, he led a heavy
column of cavalry down upon the camps in the vicinity of Middleton;
the march being conducted in the night, the darkness
and dust so impenetrable that a man could scarcely see his file-leader;
indeed, the General had to station guides all along the
route, at cross-roads, to prevent some of the columns from taking
the wrong way. The Fourth Regular Cavalry had the lead,
their advance-guard consisting of about twenty men, who behaved
most gallantly, driving in the rebel pickets, and throwing
the first camp into confusion, by an impetuous charge, entering
it simultaneously with the flying pickets themselves.</p>

<p>The rebels being taken by surprise, leaped from their beds or
blankets, without coats, pants or hats,&mdash;some, even, without
drawers. Our men cut and hacked away as they advanced, until
the rebels discovered that their assailants were but a handful
of men, when they rallied, and drove the regulars out of camp,
with a withering fire which caused our boys to suffer severely.
But that was only for a moment; Gen. Stanley was almost immediately
upon the enemy with his heavy column, and he swept
everything before him, by one grand, irresistible, overwhelming
charge. On and over the terror-stricken rebels, rode Stanley's
daring men with their flashing blades; and the Spartan band of
regulars, being thus relieved from bearing the whole burden of
rebel fire, rallied again and dashed headlong into the thickest of
the battle. On and on they sped, and so the first camp was carried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and the second brigade, under the gallant Col. Eli Long, rushed
upon the foe, the ground fairly trembling beneath the mighty
host of maddened horses, while the air was filled with the clash
of steel, the rattle of sabers, the hurried fire of the enemy, the
shouts of the victors, the hoarse commands of officers choked
with dust, and the groans and shrieks of the wounded and the
dying. Wo to the man, be he friend or foe, who fell on that
field amid that impetuous charge. He sank only to be trodden
under foot and crushed to death.</p>

<p>On rolled another wing of the command under Gen. John
Turchin, sweeping over all opposition, till it was suddenly fired
upon from a third camp. But, even here, there was scarcely
a momentary check. The doughty general raised himself in his
stirrups, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Now, boys, ve makes von more scharge"&mdash;</p>

<p>And before the sound of his voice had died away, the column
was sweeping pell-mell through the camp, among the tents and
shanties of the enemy. Frightened beyond measure, the rebels
almost ceased to fight, but threw down their arms, and thought
only of escape. Our men rushed madly on, after resistance had
ceased, until recalled by the bugle sound; after which they returned
in triumph to Murfreesboro, leading with them five
hundred of the rebels as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Every regiment&mdash;the 7th Pennsylvania, the 4th Regulars, the
4th Michigan, the 4th Ohio, and 3d Indiana&mdash;all, all, seemed to
be in their element that morning; and each member of those
regiments must ever regard as a proud day in their history, that
one on which they charged and cleared the rebel camps at Middleton.
It was a glorious victory to them, and a withering defeat
to the enemy.</p>

<p>The scene after the fight surpasses all description. The
ground was strewn with arms and accouterments&mdash;guns, pistols,
sabers, cartridge-boxes, belts, blankets, quilts, coverlets, torn
tents, riddled with balls, cooking utensils, filled with food, mess
pans, smoking hot, containing cow-peas and bacon; dead and dying
men&mdash;some of them cleft, with the deadly saber, from crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to neck&mdash;wounded unfortunates staggering about,&mdash;some supplicating
for mercy, and others begging to be relieved of their
tortures by death&mdash;some with bodies so hoof-beaten as almost to
defy recognition&mdash;these were the sights which met our gaze on
every side, and startled and sickened the hardiest soldier, as he
gazed at the result of his morning's work.</p>

<p>Here and there one of our brave boys had succumbed to the
enemy's fire&mdash;but they were fortunately few&mdash;and these engaged
our earliest attention; and while we were attending to these,
the rebel infantry, encamped two miles away, having been aroused
by the fighting, came upon us at a double-quick; but our worthy
general was not to be caught napping; and, having accomplished
his object, he recalled his men, mounted them, and returned in
triumph to Murfreesboro; but not until the enemy's quarters&mdash;winter
quarters at that&mdash;were committed to the flames; and
with them were burned thousands of small arms, while hundreds
of horses were killed, and as many saddles destroyed. This
raid resulted in almost the complete destruction of the famous
8th Confederate Cavalry, which bore the brunt of our heavy
charge. Hundreds of the bodies of men belonging to that command
lay scattered over the field; while many more graced our
triumph by being led away as captives. Our loss was small in
numbers, but no man who fell there, could have been well-spared,
as each was a hero&mdash;almost a host. We carried off our dead
and wounded; not a strap or buckle fell into the hands of the
enemy, when they returned again to their old haunts. We shot
every horse that fell into our hands&mdash;even some of our own that
broke down on the march</p>

<p>In this fight, I had little in the way of personal adventure, of
an unusual character&mdash;perhaps not so much as occurred to
hundreds of others on that day. One fellow fired a load of
buck shot through the right knee of my pants, but in return, I
worked a new button hole in his coat, with my rifle. Colonel
Long sent me with an order to Major Dobb, who was in command
of the 4th Ohio; and I "lit out," amid the dust, smoke,
confusion and clatter, in search of the Major, but succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
running up to the wrong crowd, and did not discover my mistake
till within fifty yards of the rebels themselves. I had
reached the end of a lane which ran around a ten acre field, and
come out into another that ran from a house, through a cedar
brake; and coming to this last lane, I turned down it to a party
of soldiers I saw close by. Our men were all covered with
dust, and almost as grey as the rebels; and when I saw them,
I hailed, but they refused to answer me. I hailed them again,
thinking still that they were our men, and this time rode out
from behind the fence, in full view of their lines, so that they
could see my accoutrements; and instantly a volley from the
cedar brake greeted me; and after discharging their pieces,
five of the men nearest, charged out after me.</p>

<p>I was riding a very pretty little mare that I had taken from
them, when we charged the first camp&mdash;my own horse having fallen
headlong in the fight, and as I had no time to ascertain the
cause, I seized the one I was then on, and saddling her in haste,
mounted her&mdash;and she ran past the end of the lane I had come
down, and then up into the other, so that I was nearly hemmed
in; but I wheeled instantly, and dashing back again, gained the
end of the lane I wanted to follow, about thirty feet ahead of
them. My mare was as fleet as a deer, and I left them so fast
that they soon ceased to pursue; but halting, they kept up a
steady fire across the field, while I ran around three sides of it,
and until I was out of their sight behind the friendly cedars.
I at last found the regiment in another part of the field, up to
their eyes in a fight, and delivered Colonel Long's order to the
Major and then retired to the company ranks. It was
my first attempt at playing aid-de-camp, and I readily reached
the conclusion that as an occupation, it was not calculated to prolong
the natural term of a man's life.</p>

<p>After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
my return to Murfreesburro, I went to Harpeth Shoals,
on special service. Van Dorn was then foraging in that region;
and the country was overrun with marauders. I went
about leisurely, and called on all the famous guerrillas in that
section, at their homes. They were chiefly De Morse's men,
and I spent ten days rambling about with them, scouting the
country daily, from Indian creek to Harpeth Shoals, and back
to some of the many little streams which flow past into the Tennessee.
I was disguised as a Texas Ranger, and was violently secesh,
of course; and in this character I was stopping at the
house of a notorious guerrilla, named Tom Couch. I grew patriotic
during our interview, and boasted of the prowess of the
Rangers, and expressed my opinion of those who favored the
Yankee cause, in no very flattering terms; extolled the devotion
of those who proved faithful to the South, and abused the black
hearted Abolitionists of the North, till I got old Tom's "Southern
heart" thoroughly "fired," and he could no longer retain
himself, and he spoke unreservedly:</p>

<p>"The people of this section have always stood true to the
South, sir; we can never be conquered; <i>never!</i> <span class="smcap">NEVER!</span>
NEVER! This is Dixie, and a Yankee has never <i>dared</i> to put
his foot on these hills, although we are only sixteen miles from
Nashville. If we should even catch one here we would hang
him instantly. They dare not give us a chance, but keep far
enough from us. They never can take this rough country; our
hills are all free from them, thank God!"</p>

<p>Old Tom lived on Pond creek, and there was a Tennesseean,
an officer in our army, with whom I was personally acquainted,
whose family were next neighbors to him; and I told him that I
was on secret service for Gen. Polk, and that I was authorized
to give five hundred dollars for the capture of that officer&mdash;Dave
Knight&mdash;and his delivery to me on the spot; and he was delighted
to know that the General was after the Lincolnites with
such earnestness, and promised me every assistance in his
power. He told me that Gen. R. B. Mitchel had arrested a
great many men and women, too, and confined them in the penitentiary
at Nashville, to be sent South, or punished as was
thought best; and Couch told me very confidentially that Dave
Knight's wife was to be arrested and taken South, to be held for
retaliation, along with many others. This was news to me, and
I asked him if I could <i>afford any assistance</i>, and told him if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
could, it should be cheerfully given. He then told me that the
duty had been committed to De Morse's men, and that about
three hundred of them had crossed Harpeth river, and encamped
on Dog creek. Telling him that I would go down to their camp,
I jumped on my horse, and put out. I had been in that region
the day before, but of that Couch knew nothing; and I was
aware that there was a high, steep ridge, that I could travel a
mile or so on, and see everything on Dog creek. I reached the
hill, and, sure enough, there were the camp fires of the Johnnies.</p>

<p>After dark I went up the country again, and warned Mrs.
Knight of her danger, caught her a horse, and took her to Nashville
for safety; and this I had barely time to do, as the rebels
were ahead of us, picketing every avenue of escape for several
miles around, in order to catch as many Union people as possible;
but had not yet visited her house. She was a very brave
woman, and buckled on her navy revolver without hesitation,
and when within a few hundred yards of the rebel pickets she
showed me a by-road, which she said she knew perfectly, and
that it would take us through the hills to Nashville without going
on the Charlotte pike; and this path we followed, and reached
our place of destination about twelve o'clock, in the midst of a
terrible storm.</p>

<p>Returning to Murfreesboro, I found orders to report for duty
in Ohio, and I left camp on the 3d of June, 1863, and arrived in
Columbus on the 10th of the same month.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXV.</i></h2>

<div class="center">AFTER JOHN MORGAN IN OHIO&mdash;WAKING UP THE WRONG PASSENGER.</div>


<p>My mission to Ohio was a purely military one; but I had only
one personal adventure, and that was in connection with the
Morgan invasion. When the famous and fugacious John was
making his raid, I happened to be at my home in Highland
county; and as the rebels passed within fifteen miles or less of
Hillsboro, of course, I sallied out to see what big things I could
do. Everybody and his son were after him, and why shouldn't
I go? Mrs. John A. Smith, a patriotic lady in Hillsboro, kindly
furnished me a spirited little pony to ride, and in company with
several of the young men of the town, I started for the scene
of action, supposed to be near Sardinia. When we had passed
Mowrytown some distance, we found where the rebels had
thrown the fences down, as if to accommodate mounted skirmishers,
though it might have been to favor their horse-thieves,
but which of these things I do not pretend to say; but this put
us on the alert for straggling parties of the enemy. Sure
enough, not far from Sardinia, after passing a large body of timber,
I espied a number of men, about three hundred yards off;
two of them standing in the road, talking to a man in his shirt
sleeves, while several others were in the timber. It seemed as
though all of them had horses, but some were dismounted.
Well, it was a suspicious case. Eyeing them for some moments,
I made up my mind that it was a rebel picket post, and so I
raised my gun, and blazed away. How they jumped! but they
started right toward me. At this time the citizens who accompanied
me were a little way behind; so throwing up my hand as
a signal for them to stop, I turned my horse, and started back
on the jump, attempting to reload my gun at the same time.
The motion with the gun gave the pony a scare, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
couple of quick side-jumps to the right, the little rascal flounced
me out of the terrapin-shell saddle, and the next thing I knew,
he was making his best time back to Mowrytown. Jumping
to my feet, badly "stove up" by the fall, I called out to my
comrades: "Stop that horse! stop that horse!" but the more I
hallooed, the faster they went, until in a short time they were
lost in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Thinking the Johnnies were still coming, I bounced over a
fence, and off through the woods, to a house, and borrowed a
two year old colt to ride back Mowrytown; and at the next
place I came to, I borrowed a saddle of a woman, telling about
the scrape; and in due course of time I arrived at Mowrytown,
where I found my pony, but my comrades, having succeeded in
stopping their runaway horses, had again pushed on after Morgan.
Hurrying after them, I overtook them at Sardinia, and
learned that I had fired on&mdash;a lot of citizens; and that, too,
within fifteen miles of home. We scoured around till long after
night, when I and comrade named McKee, succeeded in overhauling
them. A couple of darkies, belonging to Morgan's
command, with horses and equipments, had wandered into a
settlement of blacks in that neighborhood, and some of the
citizens thought they had been sent as spies, and that some of
Morgan's men intended to make a raid on the village and carry
off some of our black folks into slavery. Not caring to have
our black folks reduced to servitude, we started after the
supposed spies, and after a sharp chase, caught one of them, and
got both horses; and the other afterward came in and gave
himself up. The horses belonged to Captain Thorpe, of Morgan's
command; and one contraband was his servant. We
thought we ought to be allowed to keep the horses, which were
fine Kentucky stock, and so stated our claims to Governor Tod;
but that honest functionary failed to get the matter before his
obtuse official optics in that light, and so we had to give them
up. McKee couldn't see the profit of the chase; but I told him
that must consist in glory; that the credit of fighting to save
the Union, was pay enough for any man. He admitted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
point, but said, dolefully, that it was <i>poor pay</i>. After all my
running around, however, I did not get to see a Morgan man,
except in the distance. It will hardly be necessary for me, after
this story, to say that mine was not the party that captured John
and his command; but we were willing souls, nevertheless.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">OFF TO THE HIAWASSE IN SEARCH OF STEAMBOATS&mdash;A FAMILIAR NEIGHBORHOOD&mdash;FEARFUL
LEAP&mdash;AFFECTING INCIDENT.</div>


<p>Having performed the duties assigned me in Ohio, to the
satisfaction of my superiors, I was ordered back to my regiment,
and on the 7th of August, 1863, I reached it, and reported for
duty. I found the boys in high glee over the Tullahoma campaign,
which had just been gloriously terminated; but at the
same time all were busily engaged in making preparations for
the advance on Chattanooga.</p>

<p>I was at once detailed as a scout, to act under Gen. Stanley,
chief of cavalry; and under his directions I went up the
mouth of the Hiawasse river, while the army lay at Winchester.
The rebels had some steamboats, which Gen. Stanley was
anxious to get possession of, before they had time to destroy
them; and he knew they were laid up somewhere along the
river, between Chattanooga and Knoxville.</p>

<p>Starting out afoot from Winchester, I took a road in the direction
of Cowan's station, and followed it for several miles; and
when I thought I was far enough up the country, I crossed over
on Little Coon, and passed near where I had been taken prisoner
the year before. On Little Coon I stopped one day to get dinner,
and was not long in discovering that the people were "secesh,"
and thinking it might be of some advantage, I concluded
to secede for a few minutes too. As soon as I had established
the belief that I was a rebel, I inquired for old man Terry, and
asking if he was still alive; and the woman of the house answered
that he was well, adding that he was her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Let me see; didn't he catch a Yank at his house about a
year ago?" I asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Why, no," she said, "he didn't catch him, himself, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sent word to Colonel Stearns' men, who were camped close by,
and they went over to Terry's house and got him."</p>

<p>"Did you see him, yourself?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see him, for I was a milkin' when they rid by,
but the gals all seed him; they said he was a savage lookin' feller."</p>

<p>"Pretty hard case," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, the gals sed he had a real "hang-dog" face."</p>

<p>"How did he behave himself?" I asked, for I now remembered
the place perfectly well; and also of having seen a couple of
buxom girls standing in the door, who enjoyed my fallen condition
hugely, and laughed at my being tied on the horse.</p>

<p>"Why, the gals said he was a sassin' of our men as far as they
could hear him; and the gals said ef they had a been in our
men's place, they wouldn't a took it, for he was as black as any
nigger."</p>

<p>"Did the Yanks ever find out that Terry had him captured?"</p>

<p>"Oh, la, yes; and they sent a power of their men thar, and
took off nigh about everything the old man had."</p>

<p>"What did our men do with the Yank?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, we did hear," said the garrulous old woman, "that our
men took him off down to Chattanooga and hung him; and then
we heard again he had got away from our folks; ever since Terry
heard that, he's been mighty oneasy, for the Yankee soldiers
that took his truck away, said our men couldn't keep him, and
if ever he got back, he would be jest as sure to kill Terry as ever
he set eyes on him again."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon the old man would rather he hadn't have had
anything to do with it, in that case," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, la, yes; for the Yankees liked to have broke him up for
it; they driv off every cow and every hoss creetur he had, besides
he's afeared the feller will git back some time."</p>

<p>"How far does Terry live from here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About two miles and a half," she replied, adding in the same
breath; "La, it would be mighty bad ef he should happen to git
killed off and leave all them pore little children without anybody
to take keer of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember that Yankee's name?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Well now, soldier, I did hear it, but raily I have forgot it;
gals&mdash;Virginny&mdash;does ary one of you gals remember what that
Yankee's name was that got taken over at your uncle Terry's,
last spring, a year?"</p>

<p>"Virginny" now appeared in the door of the sitting room, and
no sooner did her eyes light on me, than she gave a sort of terrified
start, and retreated to the innermost recesses of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"La, gal, why don't you tell a body!" said the old woman;
"Virginny, do you hear?"</p>

<p>Thinking I would see a little fun with the old woman, I said,
solemnly: "Madam, I am the man."</p>

<p>"La, bless my soul an' body," she said, and sinking into a
chair, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, madam," I said, "I don't intend to hurt
any of you; and you may tell Terry for me, that he need not be
afraid that I will hurt him, although he caused me six long months
of imprisonment, and I nearly lost my life by it. You can tell
him that I will spare him for his children's sake, and not because
I do not think he deserves punishment. Tell him to stay at
home and take care of his children, and I will see that the Federal
soldiers do not molest him."</p>

<p>The young ladies made their appearance at this time, to soothe
their mother's agitated feelings, when I bowed to them, and with
excessive politeness said:</p>

<p>"Ladies, I wish you a very good day."</p>

<p>Finding that there was a considerable force of rebel cavalry
on Little Coon, I concluded to go back on top of Cumberland
mountain, and travel along it until I got out of danger of falling
in with them, and I accordingly changed my route.</p>

<p>Not a great distance from Cowan's station I was going down
through a long, narrow, and very crooked pass in the mountains,
when I heard ahead of me a great deal of chopping.
None of our men were in the country, so I concluded, as there
were too many axes going for the chopping to be citizens, that the
enemy must be up to some "dirt." Clambering to the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
mountain, I followed along it till I came to a projecting spur,
which I followed out and presently stood on the edge of the
bluff, almost over the cause of my alarm. At the foot of the
mountain was a party of rebel cavalry&mdash;home guards, as I supposed&mdash;who
had about fifty darkeys chopping down trees across
the road, thus effectually blockading the gap at a place where
it could not possibly have been seen until turning this short
spur that projected into it. It didn't require much soldier sense
to tell what that meant. They were fixing a trap for our
cavalry, or some other body of troops that they were perhaps
expecting to pass that way. The thing had been well considered,
and would have been a serious obstacle to any body of troops,
at that point, for a few sharp-shooters deployed along the sides
of the mountain could have then defended it against a large
force. There were about twenty rebs guarding, and fifty darkeys
at work. The Johnnies were scattered about among the
choppers, urging them to their utmost exertions; while right
at the end of the spur were their pickets&mdash;three in number&mdash;but
I was now behind them. After surveying the condition of
things, I saw that I was perfectly safe from them, for the sides
of the mountain were very steep, and I could kill every white
man there before they could climb up to me; and as for the
blacks I did not fear them. They had not fallen many trees up
to that time, so I thought I would file my objections to the
whole proceedings, and selecting a good position behind a huge,
craggy rock, I picked out the most prominent man, who was a
portly fellow, in his shirt sleeves, riding about among the darkeys,
whip in hand. He rode a fine, light gray horse, and was a
splendid target. He was about four hundred yards off and
"down hill," and knowing that a "down hill" shot is apt to
carry over, I pulled right on the horse's rump, as he was going
straight from me. A puff of wind raised the smoke from my
rifle, and I could see when the ball struck. It must have missed
the man entirely, for the horse reared almost straight on his
hind feet, and gave a terrific bound, which tumbled the rider
out of his little old "terrapin shell" saddle upon the rocks so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
violently, that he must have been severely injured, for some of
the negroes ran to him and helped him up, while several of the
white men caught and brought back his horse, which was bleeding
profusely from a point in the middle of the right hip.
While this was going on, every thing was in the highest state of
excitement. The soldiers ran together, looking in every direction,
in the wildest alarm, and every darkey ceased chopping
instanter. One fellow, who was much closer to me than the
others, bawled out at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Who fired that shot?" But he received no answer save the
echo of his own voice; but determined to know, he raised himself
in his stirrups, and bawled louder than ever:</p>

<p>"I say, who fired that shot?" but he still received no answer.</p>

<p>By this time my gun was loaded, and I took good aim at him,
and fired, just as the word "shot," "shot," "shot," was echoing
among the hills; and without waiting to see the effect of it, I
sprang upon the rock, in plain view of them, and began to order
an imaginary comrade to "run back and tell the regiment to
'hurry up,'" and then turning, with my gun loaded, I sent
another shot whizzing among them, at the same time ordering
some skirmishers to come down from the opposite ridge, and
close in with the rebels, accompanying my speech with a
violent gesture, as though pointing right at my supposed friends.
I then fired a third shot and raised a loud "hurrah boys, and
we'll surround 'em," when the Johnnies fled in the wildest confusion,
hardly taking time to help their comrade to mount his
wounded horse, which was almost unmanageable. As the cavalry
was speeding down the pass, and the darkeys were shuffling
after them, I ran back up the mountain, and descending it,
climbed the opposite side and kept on my journey, following
the top of the ridge the rest of that day, and also on the following
night and the next day until about nine o'clock in the
morning, when I was suddenly startled by the sound of horses'
feet coming behind me. I stepped behind a tree and listened,
and discovered there were several of them.</p>

<p>A spur put out ahead of me from the main mountain, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
thought if I would run out on this, they could not see me, and
would ride past. The timber was very open, and I was disappointed;
for, in coming around a bend in the road, they observed
me just as I arrived on the brink of the mountain, which
was very steep. There was about a dozen of them, well-mounted;
and they came upon me as fast as they could run through the
timber; but they necessarily had to run up to the place where
I turned off to gain the top of the spur, to follow me, and this
gave me time, and I improved it by scrambling down the steep
sides of the mountain, very fast; but I presently came to the
top of a cliff, about three hundred feet high. This looked like
a bad chance for escape, but, turning along it to the right a few
hundred yards, I again found a place where I could descend
some distance; but was then once more stopped by another cliff
which projected out like a shelf. Below the right-hand end of
this cliff, a huge hickory tree was growing, and its shaggy top
just reared itself above the shelf on which I stood, the trunk
being about eight feet from the edge of the cliff. There was no
time to lose, for already I could hear my pursuers clattering
over the rocks above me, and once I heard a saber jingle; therefore,
running to this tree, I looked over the giddy hight, then
slung my rifle across my back, and leaped out headforemost with
all my strength. I grasped the body of the tree with my arms
and succeeded in holding, although the weight of my heavy accouterments
almost jerked me loose again. Sliding rapidly
down the tree, I lit on another bench in the mountain, from
which I made my way down into the bottom of a deep ravine.</p>

<p>When I got down to the foot of the tree, my clothes were
badly torn, and great slivers of hickory-bark were sticking
through them in every direction. My hands, arms, and breast
were bleeding profusely from several wounds, cut by the rough
bark. When I struck the tree the breath was nearly knocked
out of me, and it required all my strength to hold on. I was
now safe, and never saw nor heard of my pursuers again. I
followed this, to the bottom of the mountain, and just as I got
to the mouth of the ravine, I saw a man raise his head up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
behind a log, so that I could just see the rim of his hat. Supposing,
of course, that no one but a bushwhacker would be
caught in such a suspicious place, I pulled down on him with
my Spencer-rifle and took a careful aim right on the center of
his hat. I was not more than fifty yards from him, and was
just closing my finger on the trigger, when I saw a woman's
bonnet raise up beside the hat, when I noiselessly lowered my
gun, and stepped behind a tree and waited to see what this could
mean. Presently, a fine, athletic man raised up, as straight as
an Indian; though he seemed to be laboring under the most intense
excitement. His hands were clenched, and his eyes were
fiercely glaring with passion. The next moment, a woman stood
up beside him, and set a little bucket on the log, at the same
time weeping bitterly; and as she strove to restrain her tears
with her little white hands, her bonnet fell back upon her shoulders,
and exposed a beautiful face of dazzling fairness, and features
of perfect regularity. The man raised his right arm in an
excited manner, and, instinctively, I clutched my trusty rifle,
and the thought flashed through my mind, "if you strike that
woman you are a dead man;" but, before I had time to give it
utterance, the woman, throwing her arms around his neck, fell
sobbing upon his breast, locked in his loving embrace. Great
God! how deeply my soul was agitated as I remembered how
nearly I had come to rashly firing, when the man first raised his
head from behind the log! What an escape from shedding innocent
blood, and bringing a blighting, overwhelming sorrow
upon that beautiful woman, who was now clinging so affectionately
to him! While I was thanking God that I had not fired,
the woman's voice broke upon the still mountain solitude, and
she save utterance to her frantic grief:</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry, my love, you must not, shall not go. They shall
not take you from me, and drag you away to fight a people who
have never harmed us; perhaps to be killed, or thrown into a
cruel prison! No, no, you shall not go; I will feed you here in
these mountains as long as I live, before they shall take you
from me," and she nestled closer to his manly bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Raising his hand again, as before, he replied: "Suzie, Suzie,
I will not leave you; no, I will not leave you; but I will hover
around our home, and watch over you and Willie as long as I
can; but if the worst comes, and I must fight, so help me God!
I will fight for the Union of the States as long as God lets me
live." His voice, although choked with emotion, was deep and
manly, and sounded through the solemn stillness of the forest
until the awakening echoes of the great mountain caught up
and repeated the "patriot's vow."</p>

<p>His loud, excited tones seemed to rouse a little child, that had
been sleeping behind the log; for pretty soon I heard "mamma,"
in childish accents, and then a little, bright-eyed, chubby-faced
boy, about three years old, ran out from the log, and
caught his father with infantile affection; and winding his little
arms around his parent's knees, he looked wonderingly up at his
mother, and said, in a pleading voice: "O, papa, don't go!"
The man laid one hand fondly on the child's head, and the woman
raised herself from his breast, and taking the child up, said
to it: "Willie, kiss papa."</p>

<p>As the child stretched out its arms, and put up its little
mouth, I stepped from behind my tree, and advanced toward the
group. At first they were startled at my footsteps; but when
they saw it was a Yankee soldier, they were reassured, and
gave me a cordial greeting. The man then told his wife it
was time for her to go home; and bidding her to "take the
soldier to the house, and give him his dinner," he turned up in
the mountain gorge, while the woman led the way out into the
valley to her dwelling&mdash;a neat little log house; and in a few
minutes she laid before me an elegant supper; and although it
was the last of August, the heat was scarcely felt in this cool
retreat.</p>

<p>I have forgotten this man's name; but, if I remember rightly,
he was a son-in-law of old man Russell, who lived in the head
of Dorin's Cove, where I staid that night. He had been compelled
to hide out in the Cumberland mountains for several
months, to keep from being dragged away to the rebel army;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and his wife told me how she had to take his provisions to him,
and that even her steps were watched. That she often carried
his food to the mountains in the back of her bonnet, and laid it
in some place where he could find it; but that sometimes he
would be two or three days without food.</p>

<p>I was once almost tempted to ask the old man Russell if he
didn't want another son-in-law, for he had a second good looking
daughter, whose admiration for Yankee soldiers was only exceeded
by her devotion to the cause of the Union. She complained
bitterly that their part of the confederacy was not able to afford
her a pair of shoes, although she had offered fabulous prices in
gold for them, and I, therefore, promised to bring her a pair the
next time I came that way; but this is not the only promise of
this sort that I have left unfulfilled in that country. Of course,
at the time they would be made, I would mean it; but I seldom
saw the parties a second time.</p>

<p>After passing a pleasant night at Russell's, I made my way
to Bridgeport just as Gen. Lytle arrived there. He had some
important service to do in scouting through the mountains after
some bushwhackers, who were harboring in the country from
Little Coon up to Widow's creek. Having been in that region
before, I knew just where their hiding-places were, and, of
course, we soon routed them, and I pursued my tedious journey
in quest of steamboats. While scouting for Lytle, I was introduced
to Gen. Sheridan, who was then a division commander;
and he then told me that the service was for him, and that he
would see me handsomely rewarded; but the General, I suppose,
has never had a chance to fulfill his promise, for I have not seen
him since.</p>

<p>However, it makes no difference, for soldiering, like virtue,
must be its own reward. The rebels having taken all the water
craft to their side of the Tennessee, General Lytle made a detail
of men to dig out a canoe in which I could cross the river.
It was made in the night, and early next morning I put it to a
good use, running over to the island opposite Bridgeport, and
catching a Johnny for the General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The reprobate, not knowing that the Yankees had a boat of
their own, had paddled defiantly down the river before Lytle's
headquarters, when the General said: "Pike, go and fetch that
man to me; can't you catch him in your boat?" "You just
watch the race if you don't believe it," said I, and away I went,
and soon had the Johnny standing in the presence of the General;
and like all the rest of the secesh clan that ever I caught,
he exhibited the most abject humility.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">AFTER STEAMBOATS AGAIN&mdash;A MOUNTAIN NYMPH&mdash;BOB. WHITE, THE UNION
BUSHWHACKER.</div>


<p>Leaving Bridgeport, I once more was off on my steamboat
exploits, and as I was crossing over Walden's ridge, about fifteen
miles below Chattanooga, at the top of the "cut off" I heard
a very long, and loud scream, or more like an exultant yell.
Thinking of nothing but bushwhackers in that locality, I "treed"
instanter, and stood with my gun at a "ready" to fire on any suspicious
object. Soon the sound of a horse's feet, coming almost
toward me at a run, roused me to renewed vigilance, that I
might get the first shot; for I made sure it was some rebel cavalryman.
I was not kept long in suspense, however, for in a
few seconds a magnificent horse bounded into view, mounted by
a beautiful young woman, who was riding "man fashion," or, as
the little boys say, "astraddle," utterly unconscious of observation.
Her long, brown hair was streaming in the wind, as she
was without bonnet or shawl; her short sleeves and low necked
dress, left a beautiful neck, plump arms, and a voluptuous bosom,
partially, but not immodestly exposed, while the skirts of her
dress being drawn up by her peculiar position on the horse, exposed
limbs perfect in development, and of dazzling whiteness.
She was singing, in a clear musical voice, snatches of some song
which she occasionally stopped, to give a shrill whoop at a half
wild cow she was driving before her, at a fearful rate through
the thick timber. She rode her horse with a fearless grace, and
a firm hand, guiding the spirited beast by a rope halter turned
into a loop around his nose. She soon vanished from my view,
to the left, following a well beaten trail which I was confident
must lead to a house. So quick did she come and go, and so
beautiful did she appear, galloping away through the green
woods with such a happy gracefulness, and fearless air, that I
could almost imagine that I had seen a real nymph of the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<span class="caption">"It was a fearful ride in the dark, as several of the cascades were five or six feet from top to bottom, and one, known as
the "big jump," was ten feet in perpendicular hight."&mdash;<b>Page <a href="#Page_325">325</a>.</b></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the trail she took, in about a mile and a half I
came to a house. A panting horse, of magnificent proportions,
had just been turned loose in the yard to graze, and I instantly
recognized it as the one I had seen careering so proudly through
the woods with the fair rider. I at once went to the house, and
at the door was welcomed by a pleasant looking matron, who invited
me in, and treated me with much civility, as soon as I told
her that I was a Yankee soldier and wanted lodgings. Soon
after, the fair equestrienne came in with a bucket of milk on her
head, "nigger" fashion. There was no poetry in that, it is true;
but she was really very pretty, and as she placed her bucket of
milk on the table, the elder woman addressed her:</p>

<p>"Eliza, here is one of <i>our</i> soldiers come to see us at last."</p>

<p>Then turning to me, she said:</p>

<p>"Stranger, what is your name?"</p>

<p>I told her my name and regiment, and asked what her husband's
name was, and judge of my astonishment when she answered
"Bob White"&mdash;he whose patriotic efforts in behalf of the
Union, were a theme of admiration far and wide, in that section
of Tennessee. He was what the rebels called a Yankee bushwhacker,
and was a great terror to small bands of rebel cavalry
who had to pass any where through the Sequatchie valley. He
had about thirty men under his command, and sometimes could
raise as many as sixty, on special occasions.</p>

<p>While my hostess was preparing supper for me, she and her
sister were full of curiosity to hear from the north, and especially
what our expectations were in regard to the rebellion, and our
hopes of maintaining the Federal Union. I gave them the best
satisfaction I could, consistent with duty; and they were much
pleased to hear that our numbers were so great, and our army
so well appointed, and expressed the most encouraging hopes of
our final success.</p>

<p>Supper dispatched, I went to bed, as I was very tired. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
just got well off on a scout to the land of dreams, when I was
aroused by the sound of horse's feet. The reader will understand
that on these trips I never undressed, and sometimes slept
with all my accoutrements on. The two women had put me to
sleep in a room separated from theirs by an entry; and at the
sound of horses, I sprang out of bed and bounded noiselessly to
the door and tried to open it quietly; but lo! it refused to open;
and on stooping down and peering through the crack between
the door and the wall of the cabin, I found it was fastened by a
strong chain, which was passed through a hole in the door, and
around the facing between the logs, and was locked on the outside
with a strong padlock. There was no time to lose, so turning
to the window&mdash;a single sash, held in by two nails,&mdash;I broke the
latter off, and laying the sash on the bed, I jumped out on the
ground and ran behind the house as the men hailed the inmates
at the front door; and peering around the corner, I discovered
a large squad of rebel cavalry; Mrs. White answered them at
the door.</p>

<p>"Was there a man passed here about dark, afoot and dressed
in Yankee uniform?" they inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, there was," said Mrs. White; "he stopped at my
house, and got his supper, about dark, and as soon as he was
done his supper, he left to go the 'cut off' way to Chattanooga."</p>

<p>"Who did he say he was?" was next asked.</p>

<p>"Why, he told us that he was a Georgian, and that he was
going home."</p>

<p>"You say he went the 'cut off?'" said the officer, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I don't know for certain that he did go that way,
but he told us that he was going by the '<i>suck</i>,' and, of course,
he would be obliged to go the 'cut off' from here."</p>

<p>With a polite "Thank you, madam," the officer rode away,
followed by his men, some twenty in number. Waiting to see
the last of them disappear over the brow of the mountain, I crept
back through the window and replaced the sash again, and was
soon sound asleep. Nothing more occurred to rouse me till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
midnight, except that one of the women opened the door cautiously,
and looked in, I suppose to see if I had been disturbed.
I feigned to be asleep, and she closed the door and locked it
again. Near midnight, I was again awakened by the sound of
approaching horses; and as they halted at the door, I again removed
the sash, and jumped out of the window. This party
hallooed and Mrs. White asked: "Who's there?" and one of the
men answered: "Mack."</p>

<p>I peeped around the log house again, and discovered eight
resolute men, all well mounted, and armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>"Is that you, McArthur," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, come out a minute," he said.</p>

<p>She hastily dressed herself, and throwing a shawl around her
shoulders, went fearlessly out to see them. Their conversation
was carried on in a low tone&mdash;so low that I could only catch a
few words now and then.</p>

<p>"We heard of him down at the foot of the mountain," they
said presently, in a louder tone, as if to end an argument;
"Well, tell him to come out here, we want to see him."</p>

<p>"Oh, boys, let him sleep," pleaded the woman, "for I know
he's tired; besides, I am certain he is a Yankee, for he was
talking to me and Eliza, until he got so sleepy he couldn't hold
his head up."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are a heap of men claims to be Yankees now,"
said Mack; "tell him to come out."</p>

<p>I now walked out to them, for I was certain they were some
of Bob White's men. They were very frank, telling me their
suspicions; but I had no trouble in satisfying them that I was
all right, and a friend; and then, after inquiring of the woman
whose company of rebels it was that had passed, the whole party
rode on in the same course they had gone.</p>

<p>This party had a good looking young woman with them, who
was piloting them over in the valley, to catch a notorious guerrilla,
by the name of Pickett; and the men vowed they would
hang him if they caught him. When they had gone away, I
asked Mrs. White what made her lock me up in the room:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you know," she said, "in these troublesome times a
body never knows who they can trust; and you know we had no
men folks about the house, for Bob is gone over the river, on a
scout for Gen. Rosecrans."</p>

<p>I now got along without further disturbance till next morning,
when, after a good breakfast I resumed my journey, feeling very
grateful to my generous hostess, who refused pay almost indignantly.</p>

<p>At the mouth of Soddy creek is a place called Penny's Ford.
The rebels were picketing on the south bank, and on the north
lived a very old woman, named Martin, in a house entirely
alone. Some of our prisoners, who had escaped from the south
side of the river, crossed over at Penny's Ford, and the old lady
had fed and secreted them, till they got strong enough to travel.
Of this the Johnnies had heard, and to show their <i>chivalry</i>, I
suppose; would amuse themselves by shooting at her. It was at
long range&mdash;about nine hundred yards&mdash;and to have hit her,
would have been mere accident. Every time she showed herself,
they would vault a ball over, more, probably, to see the old
woman run, than with any other object in view. She stood out
nobly, for several days; but, finally, one time, while sitting in
the door of the cabin, knitting, a ball struck the door facing,
about four inches from her head, and this so frightened her, that
she closed her house, and went to live with the old man Penny,
where I heard her relate her story.</p>

<p>I went down the river bank, and halloed across the stream,
to the Johnnies, who immediately answered; and one of them,
bolder than the rest, ran down to the edge of the water and
asked what I would have. Without answering his question, I
fired a shot at him, from my rifle, putting my sight up to eight
hundred yards. It seemed a long time going, but presently the
rebel stooped to dodge the whistling bullet, and I saw that I had
over shot; so I aimed again, and discharged my piece, holding
this time full on his head. He was standing erect when I did
so, holding to a willow bush, with his left hand, and his gun in
his right; and after a long time the ball reached its destination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and I had the satisfaction to see the Johnny tumble headlong on
the sand, his gun flying several steps from him. I then had it
hot and heavy for a while. His company, concealed by the
woods on their side, made the balls rattle on the bank where I
was, cutting the trees up cruelly, but doing no further harm,
for I was hidden in a deep ravine where I was perfectly safe;
and from which I could fire on them leisurely, whenever I got a
good "sight."</p>

<p>After having my own fun with them for an hour, I took the
road to Colonel Cliffs', on Sail creek. He was a Colonel in our
army, and I was told, at one time was on General Burnside's
staff. He was at that time away from home, on duty; but I was
hospitably welcomed by his family. I stopped here for two or
three different nights, on the last being hunted out by fifteen
or twenty rebels; I fortunately, however, received notice of their
coming before they got in sight of the house, and moved my
quarters promptly.</p>

<p>While in that part of East Tennessee, I was fortunate enough
to hear a real, heartfelt sermon, preached in favor of the Union;
and the services were closed with an ardent prayer for the President
of the United States, his advisers and counsellors; for Congress
and the success and welfare of our armies in the field.
There was no milk and water, nor soft solder about it; but it
was a real old fashioned, upright, square-toed Union sermon.
The preacher was an old, white-haired man, and his crowded
congregation were, for most part, of venerable age. The meeting
took place after night, and as there was danger of it being
disturbed or broken up by straggling rebels, I was invited to be
present. Every man was armed; and this meeting took place in
a country where some men say there were no Union men!</p>

<p>From this neighborhood I went to Chattanooga, which was
now being invested by the army of the Cumberland. On the
north side of the river was Colonel Wilder's famous brigade, and
I reported to the Colonel, and was sent by him with a dispatch
to Bridgeport, where General Rosecrans was supposed to be.
I had walked since morning from above the mouth of Soddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
creek, a distance of thirty-three miles; and the same evening I
started from the camp before Chattanooga, to Bridgeport, a distance
of fifty-four miles, over a rough mountain road. At
Bridgeport I found the General, and reported to him, and learned
that the cavalry were a long way in the advance of the infantry,
and that it would be impossible for me to overtake them; so,
after receiving orders to "knock around loose," I put out over
Raccoon mountains. These mountains are the lower or southern
range of the Allagheny mountains, and are high, steep and rugged,
while lower down the country, they are called the Sand
mountains. It is a ridge of a very irregular shape, and extends
from a point where the Tennessee forces its way between it and
Walden's ridge, on the north side, to Blountville, Alabama. Its
many recesses and deep forests have always made it a constant
place of resort for bushwhackers. In it is the celebrated Nickajack
cave, one of the largest in the United States. Over this
mountain a part of the army had already toiled, and the road
was strewn with wrecks of wagons, splintered wheels, broken
harness, crippled horses left to die, and poor broken down men
who were unable to keep up in the impetuous march that would
allow of no delay. On they were toiling over the mountain toward
Trenton, in the hope of overtaking their commands at that
place; but I fear it was a vain hope for some of them, for they
seemed very much exhausted.</p>

<p>Trenton is a small town in Georgia, and is the county seat of
Dade county. It is situated in a fine valley between Raccoon
mountain on the west, and Lookout mountain on the east; and
the valley is watered by Lookout river, and several creeks.
Here General Reynolds was encamped, and I slept there till
morning, and then pushed on for the advance. I passed Sheridan's
division, and the next was General Negley's command.
Learning from General Lytle, of Sheridan's division, that General
Negley was to lead the advance, I concluded to report to
him for duty, and found his division encamped on Lookout river,
in the valley between Lookout and Raccoon mountains, at the
foot of Johnson's crook, a narrow and meandering defile that led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
up the precipitous sides of Lookout mountain to Stevens' gap.
It was a terrible undertaking to put an army up into that gap,
as a handful of men might defend it against a host. It was held
by Wharton, with a Division of cavalry, mostly Texans; and
Negley was to scale the mountain with his Division and take
possession of it. General Stanley was hovering on the enemy's
communications far down in Georgia, in the neighborhood of
Alpine, Broomtown, and other points, almost, and at one particular
time, quite in rear of Lafayette; and at the same time, Gen.
McCook, with his corps, was toiling over Lookout at Niels' gap,
between the cavalry and Thomas' corps and Stevens' gap, his being
the right of our infantry. Reynolds crossed over with his Division,
if I remember rightly, at Doherty's gap, while Crittenden's corps
moved up the railroad around the north end of the mountain, and
General Wagner continued to threaten Chattanooga in front with
Wilder's and Minty's brigades of cavalry. Chattanooga lays in
the wide end of a Y, formed by Lookout on the west, and Pigeon
mountains on the east; the north end of Lookout rising about
one mile and a half from the west side of the town. Pigeon
mountain is a spur of Lookout, which projects itself over to the
Tennessee, about four miles east of Chattanooga. For about one
half its length, it retains the name of Pigeon mountain; while
the north end of it is called Missionary Ridge. In the Pigeon
mountains are three gaps, besides the one right at its junction
with Lookout, the most southern of which is Bluebird gap, the
middle being called Dug gap, while the most northern is known
McCowan's gap; and the intermediate valley between these two
mountains is named Maclamore's cove. It is, at Dug gap, about
nine miles wide, running to a point at the south end, while at
the north end, at Chattanooga, it is about five and a half or six
miles in width. The railroads running from Chattanooga to
Knoxville and to Atlanta, pass through Mission Ridge at the
north end; after which one keeps on up the Tennessee to Knoxville,
while the other turns down on the east side of the ridge to
Lafayette, the first point to which the enemy was compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
retreat, and which is situated about six miles east of Dug gap,
bearing a little south.</p>

<p>The reader will bear in mind that I knew nothing of the plan
of the campaign, beyond what was developed on the field, and
what was patent to all. I had passed in two days from our left,
near Cottonport, Tenn., where I saw a part of Minty's brigade,
of the 2d Division of cavalry, down to Chattanooga, where was
Colonel Wilder's famous brigade, with General Wagner, and some
force of infantry and artillery, busily engaged in shelling the
place; thence to Bridgeport, where the commanding General
was with a few troops, just preparing to go to Trenton, then already
in the hands of Reynolds' Division; I also passed the 33d
Ohio on the opposite side of the river, and saw Crittenden's
troops ferrying the stream about the mouth of Battle creek; and
from the top of Raccoon beheld the most of our center and right
encamped opposite the respective gaps, where they were to scale
Lookout mountain, and from whence they were to be hurled like
an avalanche down, down from the giddy hights of that cloud-capped
range in resistless columns into the valley, where they
were to deploy in line, and sweep across upon the unprotected
flank of the enemy, who were then in full retreat. The plan was
certainly projected by a master mind, and had it been properly
executed, would have proven the death blow of Bragg's army.
After having gained his object, it <i>seemed</i> to be the intention of
the General to draw his men in quietly, and without bloodshed,
into the fortifications around Chattanooga; and had the entire
command been properly handled, nothing could have transpired
to thwart the design.</p>

<p>General Negley began his ascent of the mountain early in the
morning of the 9th of September, I believe, and by noon had his
whole command camped on top of the mountain, and here he
sent me out to reconnoiter. It was a pretty long and dangerous
tramp, but I made it safely, and discovered that Wharton's command
was on the opposite side of the gap. The advance of the
division was soon followed by the balance of Thomas' corps, and
at the same time Gen. McCook was scaling the heights at Neil's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gap, twelve miles below, and Crittenden's was moving round
and over the north end of the mountain, while Gen. Stanley
was threatening La Fayette from Broom Town valley, almost in
rear of the rebel army. On the 10th the army was fairly bivouacked
in the clouds, on the top of Lookout, which is very broad;
in some places being four miles wide. Heavy clouds are constantly
hanging over and lapping down upon the summit, and
if it be a damp day, the top and sides are completely enveloped
in the lower clouds. It is not, however, a high mountain, being
only fourteen hundred and sixty feet perpendicular, I believe,
above the level of the Tennessee river.</p>

<p>I believe we rested a day on top, and scouted out the summit,
while in the afternoon Col. Stoughton with his regiment went
down the gap to drive back the enemy, in order that our engineers
could repair the road. I was sent out again toward night,
and passing through Stoughton's command and the rebel skirmish
line at a dead run under fire of both sides, I gained unharmed
the top of a very high spur of Lookout. I was aided
in this by the dust raised by the rebel cavalry, while the fire was
going on, and by the darkness after the fight was over. I clambered
over cliffs during the night, to gain the top, over which,
next morning, I could not look without getting on my hands
and knees. It was risky work, but it was in a good cause, and
was of advantage to the service, which was enough. At the
first crowing of the chickens I was on my feet, waiting for light
enough to see the valley below. The view extended all over
Maclamore's Cove, and is one of the finest landscapes I ever beheld.
Far to the left&mdash;perhaps sixteen or eighteen miles&mdash;could
be seen the hights around Chattanooga, while directly in front
was the range called Pigeon mountain, together with McCowan's
gap, Dug gap, and Bluebird gap&mdash;all clearly revealed by the
light in the east. I had a splendid signal glass with which I
could see very minute objects in Dug gap, and I discovered that
it was well defended by rifle pits and artillery&mdash;two batteries
being distinctly visible; while in rear of the gap rose a hill that
thoroughly overlooked it, and on the crown of this hill was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
extensive earthwork, running its whole length, and I counted
within it sixteen guns. On the side of this hill I could see a
great many brush shanties, with light, fleecy smoke rising above
them, thus clearly indicating that they were occupied.</p>

<p>From the top of the mountain I descended by a very precipitous
and rocky ravine, the bed of which in the wet season was a
roaring torrent, but now shrunk to a little babbling brook, that
found its source on the top of the mountain at some boggy
springs I had passed. At the foot of the mountain I discovered
a house nearly at the mouth of the gorge. I made for it, at first,
with the intention of quizzing the people, to see what they knew
about the enemy's movements; but when within a few hundred
yards of the place, I discovered a man sitting in the hall or
porch, which lay between the wings. He was leaning back,
with his right leg thrown over his left knee, while opposite him,
and leaning against the other wall, sat a beautiful young lady.
I knew he was a Texan by his free and easy lounging style.</p>

<p>Running noiselessly in the bed of the ravine, under the cover
of its bank, I stepped up out of it behind a huge tree, about
sixty yards from the house. Now, if I shot the fellow there,
the woman would take conniptions, so I thought I would scare
him out, and then shoot him. I stepped back into the ravine,
and hid myself, and then fired a shot in the air, and it had the
desired effect. He rose, and walking out to where his horse was
tied, picked up his bridle, and began to put it on. I got up behind
my tree again, and shouted: "Don't you put that bridle
on that horse!" He paid no attention, but as he approached
the animal's head I recognized him. His name was Bowers,
and he had served with me in Texas. Leisurely he adjusted his
bridle, even taking time to buckle the throat-latch. Again I
shouted to him to "put down that bridle," but he paid no attention
to me whatever.</p>

<p>As he stepped to the side of his horse, I ordered him not to
mount; but slowly, and without the least excitement, he swung
himself into the saddle. I wanted to save him, and so I cried
"Halt!" loud enough to be heard half a mile; but he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
quietly from me, as if to show his contempt for danger, and I
was compelled to fire on him, or allow him to escape to the
enemy, and report. Taking a good rest, against a tree, I fired
full on his back; and we were in such close proximity, that I
could see the hole made by the bullet. His horse sprang off
into the woods, but he clung to the saddle, although in the
agonies of death.</p>

<p>Hearing others on the opposite side of the house, I at once
began to play officer, and deploy skirmishers at "double quick;"
and so completely successful was the ruse, that the rebels did
not await the development of my plans, but skedaddled as
rapidly as possible in the direction of Dug gap, taking with
them the wounded man, whom they left at the next house, where
he died.</p>

<p>I missed getting his horse, which was a very fine one; as the
intelligent animal, with his dying rider, ran steadily along with
the horses rode by the others for over a mile, and until they
reached the house indicated, where the wounded man was left
to die. I was at the house an hour afterward, but found that
the horse and equipments had been taken off, and that an ambulance
had also been sent for the body, and that it, too, had
been conveyed to the rebel camp.</p>

<p>After this, I hurried over to the road by which our army was
to descend the rugged mountain, and found Col. Stoughton's
regiment in the valley, where they had skirmished the night
before, and then prepared my report for the General, in writing,
and forwarded it to him from the skirmish lines.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">BATTLES OF DUG GAP AND CHICKAMAUGA.</div>


<p>We had not been skirmishing more than an hour, before the
army began to pour down the steep, rocky, dusty road. On
they came, winding to and fro, down the serpentine road, now
enveloped in clouds of fog, then emerging from the mist, their
bright arms and brass trappings glittering in the sun; now submerged
beneath a dense cloud of dust, they would again remain
hidden for a time, till it was lifted off by a passing breeze, and
again the mighty army, as if by magic, would stand out in full
view before the beholder, martialing for the fray below.</p>

<p>The rebels beheld them in terror, and they fled in confusion
in the direction of Dug gap, leaving only a small cavalry force
to skirmish with our advance. Gen. Negley then pushed a
regiment or two out on the road, as far as Davis' cross roads,
to feel the enemy, and ascertain his position. The reconnoissance
was gallantly conducted&mdash;the rebels disputing every foot
of the ground; and as soon as the reconnoitering party began
to fall back, they hung upon its rear, until we gained our old
position, at the foot of Lookout mountain.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the General advanced with his whole
division upon Dug gap, when the enemy's cavalry again disputed
our progress, and the same ground was once more fought
over, till we reached Davis' cross roads, at which place our
army rested for an hour. The men being refreshed, pushed on
again for the gap, where the rebels were found in overwhelming
force. An engagement at once ensued, which lasted for several
hours; but as the enemy was soon strongly re-enforced, Gen.
Negley ordered a retreat, and his men were drawn off, slowly
and quietly, one brigade at a time. Slowly the artillery was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
taken off the field, occasionally halting to throw a few shells
into the advancing enemy, till finally we regained our old camp.</p>

<p>Our loss in this skirmish was about forty killed, wounded and
missing; but we lost nothing else; so leisurely were our forces
withdrawn, that the teamsters stopped to reload a wagon which
was upset. The 19th Illinois, and 18th Ohio Infantry, did noble
work in this encounter, fighting at short range, and repelling
two or three handsome charges. They killed thirty odd men, at
a single volley, near the gap, all of whom were left on the
ground by the enemy.</p>

<p>As we were proceeding toward the gap, I was frequently far
in advance of the column, looking out for ambuscades, and performing
the other delicate duties which devolve upon a scout;
and while reconnoitering, I discovered a stone wall to the left
of the road, which looked like a splendid place of concealment,
and I accordingly jumped behind a tree and scrutinized it carefully,
to discover signs of the enemy, but for some time I was
unsuccessful in my efforts. Presently, however, I saw a man
partly concealed by a clump of willow bushes, at a little distance
from the wall; and observing him closely, I saw that he
was motioning with his hand, as if to keep men down. In a
little while I discovered another, and then another, until I saw
four men crowded under the bushes, when I opened on them
with a few shots from my Spencer rifle, and as they were but
about two hundred yards off, I soon made it too hot for them,
and they hustled down to the wall, when I lit out to report the
ambuscade to General Negley. He immediately ran down a
section of artillery into a position that commanded the wall,
and then led a charge in person over the intervening hill, and
down upon the rebels, who delivered a hasty volley before our
men raised the hill, and then fled in confusion, leaving several
of their dead on the field. I chased one horse, with his rider,
over a bluff bank, about twenty feet high, into a creek; the
rider sticking to his animal all the time, till he struck the water.
The horse mired in the quicksand, and the man was compelled
to leap from his back, and leaving him, gain the opposite bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
where he leaped a fence and disappeared in a corn field, while I
was loading my gun. I then took the fellow's horse and saddle,
and broke his gun and threw it over the fence after him, though
I am not aware that he even stopped to think about it, much less
to gather up the pieces.</p>

<p>Our artillery was managed with great precision, and the
enemy must have lost heavily. We occupied the ground next
day, and we had a considerable number of their dead to bury&mdash;the
bodies having been abandoned on the field.</p>

<p>A rather amusing incident occurred just before the engagement.
I was on a scout up to the very foot of the gap. The
rebels, for a long time, refused to show themselves, seemingly
to draw us up into the gap, while they held another force that
I had reported, ready to pounce upon our flank, when their
masked batteries in front were to riddle our column with shells.
Near the gap lived a venerable widow, who had two beautiful
daughters, all Union, or at least so they told me, when they
thought me a <i>rebel</i>. Her house stood within easy shooting distance
of the rebel sharp-shooters, and inside their picket line,
although they had no post on the road. I went into the house,
and told the old lady that I was very tired, and wanted to rest
awhile, and she told me to lay down on a bed, but I preferred
the floor. I was only doing this in order to see what I could
find out; and I had been there but a little while before her little
son ran up to the door and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, here comes an officer."</p>

<p>I rolled over carelessly and asked where he was, and he told
me in a whisper that he was out at the end of the house. I was
after him in a moment, and I jumped over the fence between
him and his men, and walked stealthily along behind him, until
raising a little hill, he spied our pickets, about half a mile off.
He quickly concealed himself in a fence corner, till he had taken
a good look, then turning to go back to his own lines, he met
me, with my rifle raised and my finger on the trigger.</p>

<p>"Just take the road before me, sir," was all I said.</p>

<p>He raised his hat very politely, bowed low, and remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, really, sir, I am very much surprised to see you here."</p>

<p>Finding himself a prisoner, he took it with the best possible
grace. I allowed him to keep his sword until he reached the
post, and let him walk by me. He was such a perfect gentleman
that I hated to turn him over to the hard fate of a prisoner;
but my good manners never saved <i>me</i> when I was in <i>their</i> hands,
and so I consoled myself with the thought that he might have
had better luck. After I reached camp with him, I ascertained
that he was a second lieutenant on Colonel Corbyn's staff.</p>

<p>From some unaccountable cause, the army was detained in the
vicinity of Stevens' gap for five days; and during this interval,
the enemy was reinforced by Longstreet's Corps, and other
troops from Virginia.</p>

<p>During the morning of Saturday, the 19th of September, little
was done except closing up the trains, and getting them over
the mountains, before it was discovered that Bragg was attempting
to flank us on the left, when instantly our army was put in
motion toward Chattanooga, to prevent him from accomplishing
his object. Our march was soon discovered by the rebels;
and now began the greatest foot race the eye of man ever beheld.
My duty often caused me to ascend high points of the
ridges and hills, to see how the enemy were progressing; and
wherever they moved, the tell-tale dust would disclose their operations.
Each army was intent on gaining their fortified
ground near Chattanooga; and we had an even start, and if anything,
the shortest road&mdash;our army marching down on the west,
and that of the rebels on the east side of the Chickamauga river.</p>

<p>Great heavy clouds of dust hovered in the air, revealing the
course of each army, through its entire length; as well as disclosing
the movements of the smallest bodies of troops.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning, Bragg discovered it would
be impossible to flank our army, and prevent us from gaining
the desired point, and immediately began to close with us. His
artillery thundering on our flank, gave notice of his intentions;
and General Rosecrans accepted the challenge, and soon our
batteries were answering shot for shot, and shell for shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>This artillery dueling was very destructive for some time,
particularly on our right, where the guns thundered with
uninterrupted fury. Guns were dismounted, caissons blown up,
wheels splintered into fragments, horses torn almost limb from
limb, while the mangled gunners lay scattered in all directions
and wounded in every manner. Still the work of death went on.
When the heavy shot failed to strike among the gunners, it was
only to pass among the boughs over their heads, and by splintering
them, carry additional destructive elements into the ranks of the
supporting infantry. The shells, shrieking through the air,
burst among the men, and horses, sweeping down whole squads
of the one, or teams of the other; and when a caisson was struck,
the effect was terrific. The vehicles would be shattered to fragments,
while the powder of the shells would ignite, and throw
them in every direction, bursting as they went, and sweeping
scores of heroes to untimely graves.</p>

<p>While this was transpiring on our right, the heavens appeared
rent by a sudden crash, and the earth trembled beneath a steady,
rolling sound. The battle had began on the left, and the musketry
had opened in dreadful earnest. Peal, on peal, the sound
was borne to us, on the right, by the wind, almost drowning the
heavy roar of artillery near us, which of itself was well nigh
deafening.</p>

<p>Rapidly General Rosecrans shifted his troops from right to
left, to meet each new assault of the enemy. Each time, as the
roll of musketry raised above the sound of the cannon, it told
us that the battle continued to surge to the left, and that the
lines of our army were being stretched to the greatest possible
length. Stout hearts began to feel a misgiving, and brave men
watched the enemy with wary eye.</p>

<p>McCook's corps, on the right, held its ground. Battery after
battery of rebel guns had been silenced, but they had not yet
given back, keeping continually closed in upon our men; and
in the evening they charged upon Van Cleve's division, pouring
in three terrible volleys; but they met with a fearfully bloody repulse,
and were compelled to fall back to their old position, after
which they soon began to retire from the field they had occupied.</p>

<span class="caption">"The punishment he endured must have been severe; for sometimes he would be thrown three or four feet up in the air,

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Concentration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
on our left was the next movement in order; for
on that wing the battle was yet raging with unabated fury. Our
lines were faced to the East, with the right to the South, and
left to the North; and in rear of this were our teams, and non-combatants;
and these were hurried off in hot haste, toward
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, the 20th, revealed to us the enemy in a new
and stronger position, and much nearer to Chattanooga; and
at daylight, the contest burst forth again with redoubled fury, on
our devoted left&mdash;General Thomas this time taking the offensive.
For hours the contest continued, without decided advantage to
either side, when suddenly the enemy concentrated in tremendous
force, on McCook's corps, rushing impetuously forward and
driving it flying from the field. God grant that I may never
again behold such a scene as I there witnessed. The assaulting
column charged to within sixty or eighty paces of our lines, under
a fire so murderous that they halted, and wavered, at least
five minutes, when, reinforced by another line, the foremost men
were literally driven upon us. At this critical juncture, our
ammunition failed, and the enemy was upon us, pouring in
withering volleys upon our almost defenseless ranks, so that no
troops in the world could have withstood the assault. Panic
stricken, the corps rushed to the rear; but they were true men,
and heroic leaders were there to rally them, and thrice they
formed, and turned upon the advancing foe, who forbore to pursue
so determined an enemy. Most heroically did the fugitives
cluster around their battle flags, with tear-streaming eyes,
fondly caressing the banner they were now helpless to defend.</p>

<p>Here and there a gallant color sergeant would halt and raise
aloft the ensign of liberty, shouting out to the men not to abandon
their colors&mdash;not to give up the flag&mdash;to remember Stone
river, and not to yield, for our troops would yet be victorious,
as they had been on many a hotly-contested field. Here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
an officer pleaded frantically with the flying men; now using
words of hope and encouragement, or orders and menaces, as
either were demanded by different characters; calling upon them
to remember their country and her honor, to reflect that they
were Americans, and must fight to save their banners. They
could not resist the appeal, and three times they rallied and
waited determinedly for the enemy; each time in better order
and determination, standing ever in well-formed ranks, until ordered
to take up a new position. Nobly did those color sergeants
discharge their duty that day, not one of whom yielded
his banner, till he had first fallen beneath it. Captain Johnson,
now Colonel of the 13th Indiana Cavalry, contributed much toward
rallying the men; as did also Captain Rockhold, of the
15th Pennsylvania Cavalry, and many other officers both of the
staff and line, whose names I do not now remember. The last
man I recollect seeing on the field&mdash;and I was one of the last to
leave it&mdash;was Major-General McCook, riding even into the thickest
of the enemy's fire; and it indeed appears miraculous that
he escaped with his life. While this was transpiring on the
right, the thunder of battle still reached us from the left. What
befell the fugitives now, I know not; for, thinking they were
taking a wrong road, I left them, and going immediately to the
left, reported to Gen. Thomas for duty. He held his ground
firmly until toward night, when, during a lull in the battle, he
began to retreat. His corps was in the best of spirits, and full
of confidence in the General.</p>

<p>Deliberately every man supplied himself with a rail&mdash;whole
brigades facing to a fence for this purpose&mdash;each fellow shouldering
the biggest one he could lay hands on; and then the brigade
would reform and resume its march, the men laughing and
joking each other over their heavy work as gayly as if they had
not seen thousands of their comrades fall that day. The enemy
pursued, but the corps with its portable breastworks was invincible.
Halting in a noted gap in Mission Ridge, the troops put
their rails to use by raising, in a few moments, an effective barricade.
The General made his headquarters just in the rear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the gap, and under short artillery range of the enemy; and he
maintained his position, in spite of the rebel shells, which were
whistling over his head for hours together; and here he was reinforced
by two or three brigades of Granger's reserves, and
renewed the contest.</p>

<p>On the 21st our line reached around the crest of Mission Ridge,
something like a half-moon, with the bow toward the enemy.
The battle, however, was not severe on that day, as the rebels
appeared disconcerted. They made several feints upon our lines,
but our General was always ready for them, and checked them
at every point. At times their artillery would send shell after
shell shrieking over our heads, as if determined to frighten us from
our position; but they fired badly, as if they had lost their best
gunners in the late terrible contest. At times they would pour
volley after volley of musketry upon us, but did but little damage,
as the balls either struck our barricade, or flew harmlessly over
us, and clattered among the trees. Their next ruse was to try
to turn our right with their cavalry, and it was said that Forrest
led the charge in person. Scaling the end of the ridge, where
our right was posted, they charged furiously upon the 21st Ohio
infantry, and were handsomely repulsed, without loss to our side;
while eight of the enemy fell dead within a few feet of our lines.
The 21st followed them with an uninterrupted fire from their revolving
rifles, until the rebels were driven from the hill. This
was about the closing demonstration; and that night the army
quietly retreated to Chattanooga, leaving their camp fires burning
brightly, to deceive the rebels. General Thomas did not
leave the field until all had gone from the scene of the late conflict,
but the rear guard; and about midnight, part of General
Stanley's force appeared upon the ground, to cover the retreat.
While the battle had been raging, they had been hotly engaged
with the enemy's cavalry under Forrest, and had also been beset
with infantry. Their duty had been of a most dangerous nature,
and was performed in a gallant manner. Our cavalry lost many
daring men during the battle, chiefly, however, in killed and
wounded, though they lost a few in prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Noiselessly the army marched to Chattanooga that night.
Not a sound was to be heard save the rumbling of the trains or
the occasional word of command. When the troops reached
the town the whole aspect was changed. Uncertainty was now
certainty. We had gained the point for which the campaign
was planned and for which we had struggled so hard. Determination
could be read in every face. Filing along the breastworks
the rebels had constructed, men and officers took off their
coats and engaged in strengthening their position.</p>

<p>I now saw General Rosecrans for the first time since I left
Bridgeport. He looked wearied and care-worn, but hopeful and
determined. I spoke to him and wanted to burn the jail where
I had been confined with Andrews' men, but he refused permission,
telling me it would raise too much smoke over the town
and impede the aim of the artillery. His countenance did not
change till he rode along by some familiar regiments and saw
their thinned ranks and worn looks, when he appeared ready to
burst into tears; at that moment the men raised a hearty cheer
for "Rosecrans," when he rallied from his momentary weakness,
and galloped to the outworks in front of the town. I heard
many a man and officer swear that the town should never be
surrendered&mdash;and it never was; while the rebel columns were
soon hurled, flying back for Mission Ridge, a position they
deemed impregnable.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIX.</i></h2>

<div class="center">PERSONAL ADVENTURES DURING THE BATTLE.</div>


<p>I had some personal adventures during the battle, two or
three of which may be worth the reader's perusal. The lamented
General Lytle, who was killed in the second day's fight
at Chickamauga, held the right of McCook's corps most of the
day; and when he saw the evening closing in on him he sent
me down to the left, telling me to post on a mile or so and see
how everything stood, saying that the service was of the utmost
importance. This was on the 19th.</p>

<p>Away I went, first down in front of the rebel lines, and in
full view of them, till I saw they were preparing to advance,
when, dashing across the open place, I came over to our own
front. I turned down it to a long break in the line; I then
followed the general direction of our front for half a mile,
when I reached one of our own batteries which I found to be literally
dismantled. The caissons were blown into fragments,
the guns dismounted, and the gunners were scattered, dead and
wounded, thick around it. Poor fellows! they had been stricken
down at their posts, torn and mangled, by shell and grape.</p>

<p>I had no time to stop, as much depended on my diligence;
perhaps I held the lives of many men in my hands. I rode on,
some three-quarters of a mile further, still seeing no troops,
when I turned back. I passed the dismantled battery again,
and stopped a moment to see if I could identify it, when one
of the wounded men feebly called out:</p>

<p>"Soldier, cover me up; cover me up; I am cold; oh! so
cold."</p>

<p>The supplicatory tones were hard to resist, but I saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
enemy advancing, and hastened back to the General. As I
reached our line again, I hailed a body of troops with:</p>

<p>"What brigade is this?"</p>

<p>"Third brigade of Van Cleve's division," was the hurried response.</p>

<p>I had barely passed it when a double crash of musketry told
me that they had closed in upon the advancing enemy. I now
put my mare out to her best speed, to pass the next brigade; and
in answer to my hail, they shouted: "second brigade of Van
Cleve's division;" and I had hardly passed when a heavy volley
of the enemy's musketry whistled over the heads of our men,
and was immediately answered by the brigade.</p>

<p>The firing behind me was now both rapid and destructive.
As I passed on, hailing the next command, I found it was
the first brigade of Van Cleve's division, and as I had just
reached the end of its line, it, too, joined in the furious contest,
with a deafening crash of musketry. The firing, now, for a
short time, was intense, and the work of death terrific; but the
enemy gave way, and retired to their old position.</p>

<p>I reported to General Lytle the condition of things on his
left, and as the enemy remained quiet for a little time, Van Cleve
now closed up the gaps in the line. Before this change of position,
however, I was again sent over toward the enemy, to see
what they were doing; and I reached the creek in the thicket,
and crept on my hands and knees until I got close enough to
hear them talk.</p>

<p>"There, that's right," said one fellow.</p>

<p>"Hand me that glass," said another.</p>

<p>On raising up and looking through a fence, I saw they were
turning a battery on General Lytle's headquarters; and at once,
without heeding their shout to halt, I ran at my best speed for
the foot-log over the creek. A few shots behind me had a wonderful
effect in accelerating my pace, so that I never ran better
than at that time. I sprang on my horse just as the Johnnies
leaped out of the brush on the other side of the creek; but
before they had time to fire I was off like a shot, for the hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
I at once dismounted, and leaping over the breastworks, was
met by the General, who asked me what the rebels were about.</p>

<p>"They are," said I, "turning a battery so as to rake your
position"&mdash;and I had hardly uttered the word "position," when
a shell from it passed whistling between our heads. The shock
caused by the current staggered the General about six feet back,
and jarred me, creating a sensation such as would be produced
by a stroke on the ear by a light board.</p>

<p>The same day, in the morning, I was passing our ammunition
train, and saw on the right of it, a man sitting on a horse in an
open field, scrutinizing the train closely, up and down, and
around. He was in our uniform, and bareheaded, when I observed
him, but I soon perceived that he held a white hat in his
hand. I at once concluded that if he was a <i>Yankee</i> he had no
business there; and if a <i>rebel</i> he had still less, so I "went for
him," as the soldiers express it; that is, I went to kill him, if
I could not take him prisoner. He saw me coming, and fled to
a barn on the hill at some distance from us, and near a clump
of timber. I was about two hundred yards from the train, and
could not follow directly after him, as the creek was wide, deep,
and had high, steep banks; but some distance down was a ford,
for which I made, and when I crossed it on the jump, I saw
one of our Lieutenant-Colonels, a Captain, and a colored servant,
watering their horses in the creek. I rode up on the hill
about a hundred yards, and the barn was still about fifty
yards from me, when about thirty rebels rode out from behind
the building, and out of the woods, and fired a volley at
me. I was not hurt, but convinced that I was too close to them,
and wheeled and went back in a rather precipitate manner.
The Colonel heard the firing, and he and his party ran off down
toward the train; but as I rode the best horse, I soon overtook
them and reported the case to him. He was, fortunately, one
of General McCook's staff. I told him that it was plainly the
intention of the rebels to assault the train and blow it up; and
this, five resolute men could have easily done, without danger
to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>I now went to the friendly shelter of a rail fence close by, and
had a lively time with the rebs till the infantry got in sight,
when they mounted their horses and left; and even then they
could have destroyed the train had they known the true state
of affairs; but every now and then I would fire a shot and
give a yell, and I suppose they thought I had plenty of help
close by.</p>

<p>On the second day, I was with Lytle's brigade until after the
General was killed. He had sent me a long way out before the
brigade skirmishers, to see for him if the enemy were coming.
While on this service, I discovered an officer of the rebel army
hid behind a bush that concealed him from our skirmishers; but
I was about parallel with him, and of course, had a fair sight, and
improved it. I fired at him three times, as fast as I could shoot
a Spencer rifle; and the third bullet brought him down, his horse
galloping away to a party of mounted men still further back in
the timber. I hurried on in the woods, dodging from tree to
tree, and from one hiding place to another, until I saw the
enemy's skirmish line, which was advancing slowly, at the same
time keeping well "dressed;" and instantly I was off to inform
General Lytle that they were coming. On the line I saw a staff
officer, to whom I gave my information, and who was going to
the General, and he promised to report. I then took my place
in the line of skirmishers, and as the rebel skirmishers came in
sight, we made the fire so hot that they soon fell back to their
ranks, while we, ourselves, were ordered into our breastworks.</p>

<p>As soon as we turned to retire to our breastworks, we were
beset by a heavy fire from the enemy's columns; and one Colonel
made his men get down on all fours, and no doubt saved many
a life by this maneuver.</p>

<p>For some reason, our first line of breastworks was abandoned
after the delivery of the second volley; and as we took our position
behind the second line, I placed myself behind a large
chestnut tree, the top of which had been broken off by a storm,
and near which I had tied my mare some time before. As I felt
perfectly secure, while the rebels were coming I examined my
ammunition, and laid it out on the ground by my side, and I
found I had just thirty-three rounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i314.jpg" width="900" height="511" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"And Jack Cook, of the 37th Indiana, discharged his piece, and sent a bullet through his heart, and he fell dead at our
feet, without a groan or a struggle."&mdash;<b>Page <a href="#Page_333">333</a>.</b></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<p>When the rebels arrived within eighty yards, I began firing;
and our men held them so closely there, that at one time they
seemed on the point of breaking and flying from the field. As
for myself, I aimed every shot at their belt-plates, and before
they drove us, I had fired all my ammunition but two shots; and
at that time I got a cartridge fast in my gun. A soldier was at
that instant passing me, and I caught him by the leg, and without
seeing who he was, I asked him for his ramrod. He jerked
it out, and threw it almost directly in my face, which made me a
little mad and caused me to look up, when I beheld our army
flying in the utmost disorder down the hill on which they were
posted. I knocked the cartridge hull out of my gun; and already
the enemy were seizing prisoners, and clubbing their muskets on
such as were stubborn enough to resist. Hastily I fired my two
remaining charges, almost in the faces of the advancing rebs, and
I raised my gun to break it over a tree, when thoughts of prison
hardships flashed across my mind, and I resolved to run for my
life. The first part of the race was down hill, and I made good
time. The air seemed literally full of flying bullets. I could
hear them whistle close to my ear, down by my sides, and over
my head; could hear them strike the ground behind me, and see
them strike before me, while scores whistled, as it appeared to
me, two hundred feet in the air. Far ahead I could see my
comrades falling; and around me others, and yet others were
biting the dust; and well I knew that the work of death was
going on behind me also.</p>

<p>It was a terrible race, but I made it in safety, though I still
feel the effects of the over-exertion in my chest. It appears,
when I reflect upon it, almost miraculous that I escaped death.</p>

<p>As I had sent my rifle into Chattanooga, by Captain Rockwell,
of the 15th Pennsylvania cavalry, I carried a Springfield gun
during the rest of the fight, but only got five shots. It was in the
first part of this charge that General Lytle so gloriously fell&mdash;his
body pierced with three bullets, and his sword dripping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the blood of the foe. When he saw his noble brigade break he
drew his blade and rushed upon the enemy, but only to yield
up his life, a precious sacrifice upon the altar of liberty, dying
as he had lived, for his country.</p>

<p>This ended my adventures in this fearfully bloody struggle&mdash;one
in which our men exhibited most heroic qualities, and which
gained to us, in the end, the ground we fought for, though the
cost was frightful; and it was soon after, as every reader knows,
followed by stupendous results.</p>

<p>Long will I remember the proud look of defiance upon the
face of every man when once within the fortifications at Chattanooga.
As they were filing in the rebels reached the summit
of Mission Ridge; and as they advanced, in full line of battle,
they sent up loud shouts of victory, which were defiantly
answered by our men, with cheer after cheer, as defiant and
proud as ever. Soon the rebels opened, with shot and shell,
upon every assailable point; but they were promptly answered,
with accuracy, by our artillery, and they declined to assault us
in our position, hoping to force a surrender through famine&mdash;a
delusive phantom, as they soon discovered to their cost.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXX.</i></h2>

<div class="center">WHEELER BADLY WHIPPED&mdash;A PERILOUS TRIP OVER THE MUSCLE SHOALS.</div>


<p>At Chattanooga I was invited, by General Crook, to go with
him up the Tennessee, as there was a prospect that Wheeler
would make an attempt to get in our rear with his cavalry. Such
a movement, on the part of the enemy, might well be viewed
with trembling by every patriot; for, if our communications
were once cut, or even if only broken three or four days, it
would have compelled the surrender of the gallant army of the
Cumberland, then hemmed in within the fortifications of Chattanooga,
with only a single route for keeping supplies of ammunition
and stores to stand a siege until reinforced.</p>

<p>On the 23d and 24th of September, General Crook started,
with the 2d division of cavalry, to the vicinity of Washington,
Tennessee, to counteract, or check the intended raid, if possible.
When he arrived at Smith's Cross Roads, the general threw out
pickets at every ford, for miles up and down the river; but at
Cotton Port the enemy planted artillery and shelled our men
back from the bank, and then commenced crossing. As reinforcements
were not to be had, the general could not give
Wheeler battle at that place; but collecting all his scattered
bands, as rapidly as possible, he prepared to fall upon the rear
of Wheeler's army. At the ford, the conflict was short and
desperate; and, as soon as Wheeler gained the north bank of
the river, he marched directly across the valley to the mountains,
while General Crook pursued him rapidly. Our force,
although too small to fight the whole force of the rebels, was
still able to whip them on the raid, every time they came upon
their rear.</p>

<p>Among the first who crossed the Tennessee, with Wheeler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
command, was the rebel provost-marshal of Chattanooga, named
William Ozier, and his object was to conscript men on the north
side of the river. Major Matthews, of the 4th Ohio, had charge
of the picket, and had given orders not to fire on any small
parties coming over, but I had not heard the order. We had
been picking them up, four or five at a time, and making them
prisoners without firing a gun; and but for the fact that this
party came over; and formed in line as they advanced, I suppose
we should have continued to do so. I watched them closely, as
they came toward us, and I thought I detected them drawing their
guns for use, stealthily. With the ring of Chickamauga fresh in
my ears I may have been a little nervous; but be that as it may,
without waiting for further developments, I raised my rifle and
fired at the leader, killing him instantly while the next fellow
caught a bullet in the temple: and then the firing became general,
and the Johnnies, badly frightened, wheeled their horses
and rushed them back to the shore of the river. The one who
was shot in the head did not die. The ball struck the temple,
and passed around under the skin, to the opposite one, where it
came out&mdash;a fact which I learned from the farmer who took him
out of the river. On the body of the provost-marshal was fourteen
hundred dollars; but I took none of it. I laid him out
decently, and handed him over to the citizens of the vicinity
for identification.</p>

<p>Gen. Crook's force, at that time, did not exceed three thousand
five hundred, while Wheeler had with him seven thousand;
yet we whipped him at Cumberland mountain, on the Sequatchie
river, at McMinnville, and saved Murfreesboro, and the railroad,
and all our supplies; then again overtook him at Shelbyville,
whipped him&mdash;then forced the fugacious rebel to a general engagement
at Farmington, where he was whipped badly, taking all his
cannon, a portion of his train, and five hundred prisoners; then
we drove him from Pulaski, and overtook and defeated him at Sugar
creek, and sent him on the double quick over the Muscle shoals.</p>

<p>It was severe work; both parties displaying the most determined
courage, frequently contending in hand-to-hand encounters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
indeed, I saw rebels fighting with pistols when the carbines
of our men would be thrust in their faces. I got a good many
good shots on this raid, and had some narrow chances myself.
On two occasions the rebels fired whole volleys at me, at short
range, while I would be trying to ascertain their position for the
General; and at Farmington, I was a target for three pieces of
artillery, loaded with grape&mdash;there being not another man within
cannon range. The grape struck around, over, and under me,
but still did not touch either myself or horse. In the same fight
a fuse shell struck immediately beneath my horse, but, although
burning when it struck, it did not explode.</p>

<p>At a little log school-house, before we reached Farmington,
the rebels made a very decided stand. I saw one fellow fighting
from behind a tree, his position being secure from our men, who
were unable to get at him on account of a fence which lay in
front of him. I dismounted, and ran behind a little tree that
was near by, and, taking good aim, I shot him in the side, and
he fell, a dead man. But such affairs happen on every battle
field.</p>

<p>After Wheeler had been driven from Tennessee and Northern
Alabama, the second division, consisting of Wilder's Mounted
Infantry, went to Brownsboro, and was engaged in keeping the
county clear of the enemy, and in protecting railroad works.</p>

<p>The amount of suffering among the citizens, resulting from
this raid, was fearful. Everything eatable was seized by one or
the other of the armies. The scenes witnessed called forth pity
for the little children, who could not understand the nature of the
calamity which had befallen them; and I also commiserated a
portion of the women; but by far the larger number of the latter
did not conduct themselves in a manner calculated to excite
sympathy. They were vindictive, and seized every available
occasion to manifest their ill nature. They were ever ready to
drive their husbands and sons into the war, and they need not
have expected much pity at our hands. Many, it is true, were
always devotedly loyal&mdash;were ready to contribute to the success
of the nation&mdash;but they did not constitute a majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was at Brownsboro, a dispatch came to Gen. Crook,
by telegraph, directed to Gen. Sherman, with a request to forward
it without delay. It was handed to me to carry to him,
but none of us knew where he then was. Capt. Kennedy found
an article in an old rebel paper which stated that he was at
Corinth; but that was some time before, and we had no idea
which way he was marching. Capt. Starr, of the 2d Kentucky
Cavalry, with a squadron of men, went with me to Whitesburgh,
on the Tennessee, ten miles from Huntsville; and I there took a
canoe and run down the river, it being about two o'clock at night
when I started on my lonely ride. About fifteen miles below Whitesburgh,
I heard a noise, as if a party of men on the south bank were
bailing out a ferry-boat; and, as I thought I would have time to
pass it before it could be got ready to cross, I pushed on down.
I could easily hear them coming as I proceeded, so that I paddled
my very best; but on they came, faster and faster; I did
my utmost, but still they gained on me; another stroke of their
long sweeps, and they would be on my canoe. It was a critical
time, but fortunately at this moment a man on the shore called
out to them: "You all look as if you were going down the
river; you don't look like you were coming here to me." I
glanced over my shoulder, and there on the bank, at the edge of
the water, sat the Captain of a band of rebel cavalry; while just
above him I could see forty or fifty men with their horses.
There were six men in the boat, whom I saw distinctly&mdash;two at
the oars, one steering, and three standing gazing over the sides,
at me. They were so close on my canoe at this time, that I
raised my hand to catch the ferry-boat, in case she struck my
little craft, to prevent her from dragging me under.</p>

<p>When the Captain hailed, they headed a little more up stream,
and she missed my canoe about the length of my paddle. As
they passed by, I could see them watching me eagerly, but they
said not a word; while I plied my paddle with all my strength,
and was soon out of their sight amid the darkness. The gap I
ran through between the boat and the company on shore, was
not more than thirty yards wide. I could not possibly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
passed it safely had I made the least possible noise with my
boat; but I approached them so quietly, that the party on shore
did not discover me until I was speeding past them.</p>

<p>A few miles above Decatur I was overtaken by daylight, and
knowing very well that the river was well picketed by the rebels
all the way to Tuscumbia, I did not try to travel, but pulled
ashore under a steep bluff, and hid my canoe under some overhanging
willows, and hid myself in a cleft in the rocks to sleep
and rest till the next night. It was in the latter part of October&mdash;about
the 26th or 27th, I believe&mdash;and I had rather a cold time
of it, among the stones. During the day a company of rebel
cavalry rode along the top of the bluff, just over my head, but
they did not see me, and I rested well till dark, when I pushed
out in the stream and resumed my journey. I passed Decatur
while the lights in the houses were still burning, and as I rowed
by the foot of the main street, a single shot was fired on the
bank&mdash;the flash of the gun being toward me&mdash;though I did not
know what they were shooting at, nor did I call to inquire.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Lamb's ferry, just at the head of
Muscle Shoals, I laid down in the bottom of my boat to rest a
little, as I was very tired and sleepy. How long I slept I do not
know,&mdash;not more than an hour, I think&mdash;when I heard a chicken
crow, and waking up, I found I was floating by a house on the
bank. I picked up my oar and began to paddle leisurely on,
too tired and sleepy to work hard, and in a short time I passed
another house. It was dark, to be sure, but still I could see
that it bore a striking resemblance to the first one. Two
brothers, I thought, live on adjoining plantations; or perhaps
an old man and one of his children, and have built houses alike.
I still pulled on, but lo! in a short time I passed another just
like the other two. This was unaccountable for a minute, but I
remembered I had seen a big cottonwood tree on the bank at
each of the other houses, and now I thought of it, they too
were as the houses and fences&mdash;all, all exactly alike; what could
it mean? Was I bewitched? I started directly across the river,
to the opposite bank, resolved to leave a country where such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
sameness prevailed. It savored too much of enchantment to
suit me, so I would go elsewhere; but as I approached the channel,
I discovered that I was in a big eddy, caused by an island
on one side, and a sweeping curve in the bank on the other, and
that I had been floating around in a circle&mdash;how long, I could
not tell.</p>

<p>Shortly after I pulled ashore on an island, to pass another
day, hiding my canoe under the overhanging boughs, which projected
far out over the water, and lying down in my boat to
sleep. After taking a long nap, I was awakened by a rattling
in the chains of my boat, and raising up and peering over the
gunwale, I espied a large, fat raccoon, reared up on his hind
legs, playing with the loose end of the chain, as it dangled from
the limb it was tied to. His look was astonishingly intelligent,
and he enjoyed the sport till the swinging of the iron hit him
on the nose, when he hustled off up the bank and was seen no
more. Scarcely, however, was he away, before a mink came
trotting down to the end of my boat, and cast an inquiring look
into it; but one glance sufficed him, and he was off like a shot.</p>

<p>Nothing more occurred to disturb me, till I discovered a
company of rebel cavalry on the north bank of the river.
Nearly opposite where I lay; on that side, was a house; and as
the cavalry approached it, I saw an old man bring an officer
down to the water's edge, and point out to him where I was
hid; after which the latter rode back to the company, when they
all moved off down the river, and I began to flatter myself that
I should not be disturbed. Still, I thought it best to keep a
good look out for them, and I soon saw them about three-fourths
of a mile down the river. They came to the bank and I was satisfied
now that something was to be done. They dismounted,
and six of them got into a large canoe, and pushing off, set out
toward me, coming a considerable distance, when they appeared
to be called back by the party on shore. A brief consultation
then ensued, and they again pushed out in the river; but this
time they steered below the end of the island, and again I was
almost ready to believe I would not be disturbed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
about half an hour I heard them paddling up the river on
the opposite side of the island, which was here very narrow. I
watched them closely, and discovered that they were not more
than seventy-five yards off, and coming rapidly; so, quickly
loosening my boat, I pushed out in the stream, and was away
down the river. I put out all my strength until I passed the
men on the shore, and as I was sailing by at a safe distance
from them, they hailed me with the order, "Come ashore with
that boat;" but I could not see it in that light, and redoubled
my efforts at the paddle. I heard their guns, bang, bang, bang,
in rapid succession, but it was a useless waste of ammunition,
for I was now flying through one of the swiftest shoals on the
Tennessee, and was out of range with almost lightning speed.</p>

<p>The Muscle Shoals are forty miles long, and I was now in the
head of them. In some places the river is very wide&mdash;perhaps
two miles&mdash;while in other places, far more narrow, and there
is a long series of cascades, down which the water rushes foaming
and roaring, dashing and thundering, among the rocks&mdash;sometimes
for miles&mdash;lashed into foam by its own impetus, and
then pouring over perpendicular falls, and breakers in the rocky
bed. It was a fearful ride in the dark, as several of the cascades
were five or six feet from top to bottom, and one, known
as the "big jump," was ten feet in perpendicular hight; or so,
at least, I was informed by men who followed boating over the
shoals. The most dangerous ride I had was by a point on the
south side of the stream, called Green's bluff. By running on
that side, I avoided the highest part of the "big jump;" and I
made my way over it in safety, though not without some bruises,
and a thorough drenching.</p>

<p>At South Florence I saw innumerable camp fires, and was at
a loss to account for it. During the day, while laying up on an
island, I heard the reverberations of cannon on the water, and
now here was a camp in full view&mdash;perhaps the very one I was
searching after. I was in a swift, but not turbulent part of the
shoals, and I determined at once to reconnoiter, and therefore
pulled my boat around, in full view of the camp fires&mdash;some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
which were near the water's edge&mdash;and discovered the gray
uniform of the sentries, and I was, of course, off again in the
distance, knowing that I had passed an army of rebels.</p>

<p>I well knew that at least a portion of our army was near them,
or why the firing I had heard? A little further down and I discovered
the piers of a railroad bridge, the woodwork of which
had been burned; and I felt satisfied that it was on the road
leading to Tuscumbia. Still, however, I did not see any suitable
place to land, till a long way below that point, when I discovered
a narrow road leading out from the water's edge, and up to it I
pulled my little craft, resolved to find a house and get some information
about the movements of troops in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>While hunting for a house, I heard the beating of a single drum
off in the distance; and shortly after, followed a "reveille," but
far away from where I was. Advancing carefully to reconnoiter,
I discovered a picket just before daylight, and stealing up toward
him, behind a thick growth of weeds&mdash;for he was near a fence,
the corners of which had not been trimmed&mdash;I was soon near
enough to touch him with my gun, when I called out to him to
know his regiment, and he responded: "The 5th Ohio."</p>

<p>What weight and doubt was now removed from my mind! He
was a friend! I had feared that I was approaching a rebel camp,
but now my misgivings had vanished into air! I now told him
that I had dispatches for General Sherman, and wanted to pass
into camp, and he called the corporal, who sent me in without
delay.</p>

<p>I found Tuscumbia in possession of General Blair's troops;
and the General furnished me a good breakfast and an ambulance
to Cherokee station; and from here, by order of General Wright
I was conveyed on a special train to Iuka, where Sherman then
was; and I at once delivered my dispatches, which were not yet
three days old. No sooner had I delivered the documents, than
my strength utterly failed me, and I sunk down exhausted, before
I could reach the place assigned me to rest.</p>

<p>The service I had performed was most arduous and dangerous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
but let General Sherman himself describe it, and its importance,
which he does in the following document:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi,<br />
Nashville, Tenn.</span>, April 16, 1864.<br />
</div>

<p>Corporal James Pike, Co. A 4th Ohio Cavalry, in October, 1863, carried a
message from General Grant to me at Iuka. He got a canoe at Whitesburg,
opposite Huntsville, and came down the Tennessee, over the Muscle
Shoals, all alone, for over one hundred miles of river, every mile of which
was picketed by the enemy, and reached me safely, as stated, at Iuka. It
was that message that hastened my movement to Chattanooga. The whole
affair is highly creditable to the skill, courage and zeal of Corporal Pike.</p>

<div class="right">
(Signed,) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  W. T. SHERMAN,<br />
Major General.<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The same dispatch reached him in two other ways. Corporal
Brant and private John Wakefield, of the 4th Ohio, went down
the north bank of the river with it, and Lieutenant Fitzgerald,
with a hundred 4th Regulars, got through with it; but I do not
believe either of these parties could have been successful if I had
not first made it by the river.</p>

<p>In about two hours after I delivered the dispatch, General
Sherman put his army in motion for Chattanooga; and as soon
as the first division began to cross over, the rebels who occupied
the north bank, crossed over on the shoals, and joined Wheeler
on the south side, thus opening the way for the other two parties
to reach the General, which they could not otherwise have done.</p>

<p>As soon as I rested a day, I started back up the country, with
Brant, and Wakefield, to report the advance of Sherman's army
to General Crook. I told General Sherman that I needed a
horse, and he replied that I should take the best animal there
was in Tishamingo or Lauderdale counties; but after careful
search and patient inquiry, I found that his own men had not
left a single one in the country that was able to go; and when I
reported the result of my investigation to the General, he kindly
borrowed one for me, with saddle, bridle and blankets; and I
need hardly state that I forgot to return them.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time the army reached Chattanooga,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and in two days participated in the battles of Lookout mountain
and Mission Ridge; and in the glorious victories won on those
stoutly contested fields, I felt myself amply repaid for the dangers
I had encountered in my journey over the Muscle Shoals by
night.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXXI.</i></h2>

<div class="center">RAID IN NORTH CAROLINA&mdash;REBEL COLONEL WALKER KILLED.</div>


<p>On our return, we found Elk river exceedingly swollen; so,
leaving our horses with a Union man in the neighborhood, named
Hugh McLamore, we walked up the bank of the stream in search
of a boat, as an attempt to swim it would result in almost certain
death. We proceeded at least ten miles, when we saw a
canoe on the opposite side, which was the property of a notorious
old rebel; and immediately two of us hid, while the third
called the boat over. Not dreaming who we were, but evidently
supposing the hail was from a rebel soldier, he sent one of his
negroes over with the craft at once; but no sooner did it reach
the shore, than we all three sprang in, to the astonishment and
terror of the darkey.</p>

<p>On reaching the stable, we confiscated two fine mules and a
carriage horse, the old rebel raving and swearing all the time.
We laughed at his passion, and rode off, without damaging his property
or injuring him, our seizure of the animals being merely
for the good of the service.</p>

<p>At this house we learned of a Capt. Richardson, who commanded
a company of guerrillas, and who was at a place called
Bethel church; and immediately we set out for the point indicated,
but found only one of his men and two horses, as some
one had given notice of our approach. This fellow was just
leaving the camp with two very fine animals; and as soon as he
discovered us, he darted off down a narrow road, with us immediately
after him. Before we reached the road, a man turned
into it with a pair of wild young steers hitched to a cart; and
as we charged down, the steers ran off, following closely the
guerrilla. The chase now became exciting. Away we all went,
pell mell, the wild oxen making about equal time with the flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
rebel, and we doing our best to dash by them, and the vehicle
to which they were attached, to catch the Johnnie.</p>

<p>The driver of the steers was short, thick, and fat; and when
the cart was thumping over roots and stumps, he threw himself
down on the bottom of the bed, and fairly roared with fright and
pain. The punishment he endured must have been severe; for
sometimes he would be thrown three or four feet up in the air,
and then fall back again into the cart with a thump that made
him roar again. But as we lost the guerrilla by his team getting
in our way, we pursued him on, chasing him another mile or
so&mdash;indeed, until the cattle were completely exhausted, and
could run no more. We then reached the Athens road, and
there gave him a little parting advice; for we felt sure that he
was the man who had warned the guerrillas of our approach;
and after concluding our admonition, we struck out toward
Athens.</p>

<p>This was once a handsome little town, the buildings possessing
taste, and being of a substantial character; and it has been
rendered somewhat famous as the first place where one of our
commanders promulgated the doctrine of retaliation. At the
time we passed through it, it was almost in ruins; the chief
buildings having been burned by order of Gen. O. M. Mitchell,
in retaliation for guerrilla depredations.</p>

<p>From Athens we proceeded to Huntsville, and thence to
Brownsboro, where we found Gen. Crook, who was highly
pleased with the success which had attended our efforts.</p>

<p>As the General expected to remain for some time in command
of the second cavalry division, he at once made a detail of scouts
to operate with me; his plan being to have them well drilled in
their business, and then employ them in acquiring information
of affairs within the enemies lines; and also as flankers and flying
sentinels when the command was on the march. The men
detailed were a gallant set of fellows, and they did a great
amount of good service; but Gen. Crook being ordered to Virginia,
was succeeded by Gen. Garrard, who did not approve of
our "style," and so disbanded our organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after being detailed on this service, we were sent out on
a scout by Gen. Thomas, the object being to burn the big railroad
bridge at Augusta, Georgia; and if it were possible to do
so, the one across the Congaree, on the road between Branchville
and Columbia. Aiken was another desirable point to reach,
where we might do incalculable mischief to the enemy's communications;
but Augusta was the grand objective point, as here
was located the most extensive powder mill in the entire Confederacy,
as well as one of the largest, best, and most important
bridges. To destroy either the powder mill or the bridge, was
to inflict irreparable injury upon the rebel cause, and hence the
importance of success.</p>

<p>We set out in the winter, and succeeded in getting as far as
the little town of Murphy, in Cherokee county, North Carolina,
where we found the snow was so deep in the mountains that it
was impossible to proceed farther; and we accordingly turned our
attention to affairs in the immediate vicinity of where we then
were. We were accompanied by a party of citizens, who aided
us to the extent of their power, and gave us all the information
we needed. We ascertained that one Col. W. C. Walker, who
formerly commanded a brigade at Cumberland gap, but who was
now at home with plenary conscripting powers, was creating
much trouble in the county; he being enagaged in carrying into
effect his sweeping powers, with all the energy at his command,
and all the cruelty of his nature. He had already sent a large
number of unwilling conscripts to his camp, on Notely river,
some of whom, however, managed to desert, and reached our
lines, reporting to Col. Long, then commanding the forces at
Charleston, on the Hiawassee, in Tennessee. Nothing discouraged,
however, Walker continued to pick up men wherever he
could find them; and although he had but forty or fifty men in
camp upon whom he could rely, he had a full set of officers in
camp for a maximum regiment&mdash;that condition of officers being
the result of the inordinate ambition of the <i>Southern</i>, or perhaps
I should say <i>secesh</i> heart.</p>

<p>After mature deliberation, we concluded to abandon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
original mission altogether, and take the "dashing" Colonel
prisoner, and conveying him back with us to Chattanooga.
Subsequent events, however, convinced us of the truth of the
old adage, that it takes at least two to make a bargain; for the
Colonel refused to be taken.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dusk, on New Years' night, of 1864, we
sallied out from a place of concealment, and went to Walker's
house, and after surrounding it called upon him to surrender.
He immediately demanded to know who we were, and we replied
that we were Yankee soldiers; and that if he gave himself up
he should be treated like a gentleman, and "as a prisoner of
war;" but he replied with an oath that he would do no such
thing. I then informed him that resistance would be useless, as
his house was surrounded, and that we would take him, dead or
alive. He responded to this threat, with:</p>

<p>"<i>I will surrender when I please.</i>"</p>

<p>Knowing that he had constantly about him a body guard, I
concluded to storm the house, before they had time to rally to
his assistance. Seizing the door step, which was a short, heavy
log, I broke in the door, in front, while the men behind the
house proceeded to demolish that in the rear. Walker retreated
to an inner room, and made a stand to sell his life as dearly as
possible, twice more refusing to surrender. We soon demolished
the two doors to this room, as we had done the outer ones. Still
anxious to save his life, I drew a bead on him with a pistol, and
ordered him again to yield himself a prisoner. He was standing
with a Sharp's carbine, almost ready to shoot, before I succeeded
in drawing my pistol; but, fortunately, I was too quick for him.
Seeing I had the advantage, I again called on him to surrender,
when, after a moment's hesitation, he replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, I'll surren&mdash;&mdash;," and partly turned to lay his
carbine on the bed, when his wife caught my arm, and, by a
violent jerk, destroyed my aim. Quick as thought he wheeled,
and raised his gun to shoot me, but the other men had got in,
to assist me, and as his wife still clung frantically to my arm,
his daughter, a beautiful young lady, threw herself partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
between us; still, however, he appeared bent on shooting me,
and I told the boys to fire on him; and Jack Cook, of the 37th
Indiana, discharged his piece, and sent a bullet through his heart,
and he fell dead at our feet, without a groan or a struggle.</p>

<p>The work had been more quickly done, than it requires me to
relate it; and as we had no time to lose we prepared for defense.
We heard quite a large party in another part of the house;
we formed before the door of the room occupied by his body
guard, and rushed at it; and I succeeded in throwing myself, and
log of wood, on top of the shattered door, in the middle of
the room, and directly among the rebels, who were now prepared
for a serious resistance; but our onset was so impetuous, that
for a moment our enemies were paralyzed, and in that brief interval
we gained a decided advantage, being the first to come to
an "aim" and the Johnnies at once surrendered. There were
six or eight of them, including Walker's son, who was the
Sergeant Major of the regiment; and we captured the entire
party, without firing a shot.</p>

<p>After we had secured our prisoners, we took the Colonel's
horses, as well as all that we could gather up in the neighborhood,
and started on our return to Chattanooga. Our route was
a tedious and laborious one, over the Frog mountains, which were
then covered with ice and snow&mdash;the cold being intense.</p>

<p>The view from the top of Frog mountain, is one of the grandest
in North America; but we had no time to enjoy the
magnificent scenery, as there was every prospect that we should
be rapidly pursued. At Murphy, seven miles from Walker's
house, were about thirty home guards; at Ducktown, five miles
away, were also about the same number; and at Blairsville
was Young's whole battalion, while there were but ten men in
my party, besides a few citizens&mdash;rather a small number to
venture so far in the enemy's country. We were, however,
well armed and equipped, and bountifully supplied with ammunition.</p>

<p>After nearly freezing, two or three times, in the mountains,
and suffering severely from hunger and fatigue, we at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
reached Charleston, and turned over our captives to Colonel
Long, who was still in command at that place.</p>

<p>We traveled so fast that young Walker was seized with a
violent pain in the breast, so I thought rather than be hard on
him, I would parole, and leave him, which I did at the house of
a noted secessionist; and he promised to nurse him till he
became well enough to return to his family.</p>

<p>Some time after this I was in South Carolina, and heard,
incidentally, that young Walker had run off to that State, in
order to save himself from being killed by his Union neighbors.
He might as well have braved it out at home, for a Union man
in South Carolina killed him on Tiger Tail creek, and sent his
body to Walhalla.</p>

<p>Before leaving North Carolina, I turned another prisoner loose,
with instructions to notify every officer of Walker's command to
leave the country at once, or I would return with a stronger
force and send them all after their colonel; and while passing
through the country some time after, I learned that they had all
obeyed my injunction. We likewise, in one place, called for a
certain Captain Stanhope Anderson, but he was not at home; so
we took down his knapsack from a nail where it hung, inspected
his papers, and then threw the whole outfit it contained on his
own fire; then took his pistol and ammunition, broke into his
apple holes, and helped ourselves to all we could carry with us;
after which we directed the overseer to inform the captain that
if he didn't quit the rebel service, and turn to be a good Union
man, we would come back and take his life. On going back, I
found that he, too, had heeded our admonition, and that he was
then thoroughly loyal, and the original Unionists in the vicinity
all spoke well of him since his change of views.</p>

<p>When he entered the rebel service, he swore, in a public speech,
to come back with death in his hand, or victory on the point of
his sword; and I think he owes me a real debt of gratitude for
working his conversion without driving him to extremeties.</p>

<p>I only relate this incident here as an illustration of a view I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
have always entertained, viz: That public opinion is an article
of manufacture, as well as boots or shoes.</p>

<p>After reaching Colonel Long's camp at Charleston, and resting
ourselves, we started for Chattanooga, taking canoes at Cottonport;
and on arriving at my place of destination, I reported
to General Thomas, after which I returned to Huntsville, to
General Crook.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXXII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">BRIDGE BURNING EXPEDITION TO AUGUSTA.</div>

<p>We scouted awhile for General Crook, then for Colonel Miller,
and Gen. Logan; and upon orders from the last named, we burned
up nearly all the distilleries in North Alabama; but when Gen.
Garrard took command, as already stated, the scouts were disbanded,
and I returned to Gen. Thomas again.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of narration occured to me now, till the advance
from Chattanooga upon Rocky-face Ridge, when I participated
in part of one day's fight.</p>

<p>The project for the destruction of the railroad bridge at Augusta
had been recently revived. If that structure could be destroyed,
it could not be repaired for months, and the damage to
the enemy's communications would be worth an immense amount
to us. Could I slip around and burn it? And then amid the
confusion resulting from it, would it not be possible to give a
little attention to the powder mill, and blow it to fragments?</p>

<p>I started for Nashville at once for an outfit, consisting of
matches of a peculiar manufacture, phosphorus and steel arrow
heads for throwing it; and while in the city, I was joined by a
man named Charles R. Gray, who volunteered to go with me.
We set out from Nashville for the front, and arrived there during
the battle at Rocky-face Ridge, and we both went in. It seemed
to be a free fight, and every man I saw was doing something,
and of course I could not be idle. The rebels had a decided advantage
in position, being at the top of the ridge; and they
wounded a great many of our men, by rolling huge stones down
on them. But I did not get to see all of the battle, as early on
the morning of the second day, we set out on our journey&mdash;Gen.
Thomas having just commenced a maneuver to flank the enemy
on the left, as stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>We went to Chattanooga by railroad, riding on the General's
"dummy" car, and from thence proceeded to Charleston, Tennessee,
on a freight train; and from that point we were compelled
to fall back on first principles&mdash;to travel on foot.</p>

<p>From Charleston we followed the Hiawassee some distance, and
then leaving the river, crossed the Frog mountains again, and
then returned to the river, at Murphy, in Cherokee county. On
the way we encountered some tough times and some pretty merry
ones. On one occasion we stopped with an old man, whose
family consisted of himself, wife, three daughters, and a daughter-in-law,
all of whom were Union, except the last named, who was
secesh to the back bone, and was prepared at any moment to do
anything in the world for the rebel cause. We were not in the
house long before we made ourselves familiar&mdash;Gray, my partner,
directing his conversation to the daughters, while I entertained
the daughter-in-law, and soon had her convinced that we were
rebels in disguise. She was pleased that we were devoting our
attention to the Hiawassee valley, and wished us every success
in our enterprise, whatever it might be; and when I told her my
business was ferreting out deserters, who were secreted in that
region by the Lincolnites, her admiration of our patriotism was
unbounded.</p>

<p>After thus gaining her confidence, I began questioning her as
to the different bodies of troops stationed higher up the river,
and through which we were compelled to pass, and I found her
thoroughly posted; and the information she gave me proved, on
subsequent observation, to be correct. To my inquiry about
the state of the country, and as to whether there were any lawless
characters infesting the mountains, she replied:</p>

<p>"No; there are none now, nor has there been since last winter,
when Old Spikes and a lot of Yankee bushwhackers came
upon Persimmon creek and killed Colonel Walker. Ever since
that time the country has been mighty quiet."</p>

<p>"Wasn't his name Pike, instead of Spikes?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; that <i>was</i> it; and they say he was a mighty hard
case&mdash;a perfect savage," said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what was our cavalry doing," I asked, "that they
didn't pursue and capture the villains?"</p>

<p>"Well; a lot of Colonel Young's home guard did get after
them," was the reply, "but they killed the colonel in the night,
and took to the mountains right away, and our men never found
them."</p>

<p>She was eyeing me curiously now, and presently she asked:</p>

<p>"Stranger; what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Frank Barton, madam," I replied, without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Waco, Texas," said I; and I launched off into a description
of Texas and its people, stock raising, agriculture, etc., and
soon got her thoroughly convinced that I was really telling her
the truth.</p>

<p>We had an excellent supper here, and pushed on up the river.
Whenever we found a friendly neighborhood we would stop at
houses; but, when we wouldn't like the appearances, we would
hide out in the woods. When we lay out we would steal
chickens and take them into the woods with us; and if we failed
on poultry, we killed a hog: and as for bread, we never thought
of it. When we got into the neighborhood at the base of the
Blue Ridge, we found the people very much exercised in regard
to their stock. The rebels had sent them word to have their
cattle gathered, as they would be after them in two or three
days, to take them off to the army. It was Colonel Thomas&mdash;the
notorious Bill Thomas, commanding a legion of Indians,
who sent them the order; and the people were fully determined
to resist the seizure of their stock, and sent Thomas word that
if he got their cattle he must gather them himself. There were
perhaps sixty able-bodied men, who were armed and willing to
resist if the rebels came into their neighborhood to enforce the
order; and Gray and I joined the insurrectionary forces and
helped to promote the spirit of resistance among them. We
waylaid the pass in the mountains, through which the rebels
must necessarily come, for a couple of days; but Thomas must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
have learned, by some means, that the people were armed and
awaiting for his arrival, as he did not come.</p>

<p>We practiced target-shooting, one afternoon, with several
of these mountaineers, just for the sake of making a favorable
impression among them. Gray held a cap box between his
thumb and finger for me to shoot at, and to show the confidence
we had in each other we exchanged positions, and I held the box
as a mark for Gray's bullet. The distance was fifty yards.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 20th of May we scaled the Blue
Ridge&mdash;a very severe undertaking, and one which caused us
great labor and fatigue. When one stands at the foot of the
mountain and looks up, the summit appears wrapped in a blue
haze; and when on the top, looking down, the foot appears
belted in blue, a shade or two deeper than azure.</p>

<p>From the summit of this ridge the view is indeed grand and
picturesque. Other mountains rise up in every direction, to
meet the vision&mdash;"Great Smoky," in East Tennessee, being
among those distinctly visible from the point where we then
stood. It is no unfrequent occurrence for it to be raining
down in the valleys, while on the summit of the ridge the sky
is perfectly clear and the sun shining. Going along the top of
the Long Ridge, or as the natives call it, the Ridge Pole, we
were astonished at its hight and singular formation&mdash;it being, I
believe, the most elevated point of land in the Alleghany
mountains, though my data on this subject is by no means positive.
The summit of the ridge is extremely narrow&mdash;being
not more, in many places, than six or ten feet in width&mdash;the
descent on the west side being regular, but steep, while on the
east it is little else than a precipice for a thousand feet down.</p>

<p>One particular feature of these mountains is the fact, that both
sides and tops are covered with a deep, rich soil, of very dark,
or black color, the tops, however, being so high as to be destitute
of timber.</p>

<p>Descending to the foot of the ridge, on the eastern side, we
came to the head waters of the Tallulah river&mdash;so called by the
Indians, on account of its extraordinary falls, which are, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the highest in the country, though no single fall is as high
as others which might be mentioned. There are five cataracts
in a quarter of a mile, the water descending four hundred feet
altogether. The roaring of the waters can be heard an incredible
distance; and no wonder that the red men named it Tallulah&mdash;thunder
river.</p>

<p>We followed the stream to its junction with the Chattooga,
where the two form the Tugalo, being conducted on the route by
a man named Ramy, whom we hired to pilot us through the
most dangerous sections of the country, the distance being
twenty-eight miles. He was a perfect specimen of a backwoodsman,
and loyal, after the most rigid definition of that
word. Near the mouth of the Chattooga a brother of his
lived, who had a son in the rebel army and who was a violent
secessionist. He was member of Young's Georgia cavalry,
which was at Clayton, then only six miles away.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Blue Ridge, we had frequently passed
off as rebel soldiers in disguise; but generally for Union men&mdash;always
suiting ourselves to the company we were in, or as our
interests demanded; but on the east side, we knew that we had
nothing to expect from citizens if we claimed to be Yankee soldiers,
as they were nearly all against us, and, therefore, we almost
uniformly represented ourselves as rebels on our way to Augusta
to join our regiments. We belonged, we stated, to the 4th (confederate)
Kentucky Cavalry. But we had as little to do with
the people as possible; but when we could not avoid meeting
them, we told this simple story with occasional variations, to
satisfy the curious and the doubting.</p>

<p>Young Ramy was at home when we reached his father's house,
and in the morning we left early, telling the people we were
going to Walhalla, to get on the morning train; but as soon as we
were out of sight, we turned down the Tugalo, and stole a canoe,
below the first shoals, and traveled constantly till we ran our
boat aground on a shoal, and were compelled to abandon it and
wade ashore, trusting to our chances to obtain another craft.</p>

<p>When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> daylight overtook us, we hid out in the mountains, on
Brasstown creek&mdash;a stream noted for its high cascades. Traveling
on the river by night or by day, as best suited our purposes,
we finally reached the head of the canal, seven miles above Augusta;
one day, at noon time, we passed through a section of
the country where a large number of Col. Bill Thomas' Indians
were quartered&mdash;some farming, some tending stock, while others
were making baskets, and yet others were fishing. All appeared
busy, in a lazy sort of Indian way; and most of them had been
wounded in the rebel service. Being unfit for active duties, they
had been sent to this part of South Carolina to recruit themselves,
and to raise something to support the tribe who were entirely
helpless. They were Cherokees, who have always lived on the
Tuckasege river, and at Qualla town, on the Qualla river, in
North Carolina. They were the saddest appearing Indians I
ever saw, and seemed to have lost the last vestige of that firey
independence which characterizes their race: and as far as I
could discover, they had not been benefited by intercourse with
the white race.</p>

<p>The Tugalo is one of the most beautiful streams I ever beheld.
Its banks are finely diversified with mountain scenery, generally
in the distance; while the bottoms are in the highest state of
cultivation&mdash;indeed, some of the finest plantations, and best
built mansions in all the southern country, are on this river.
At times, the water, which is always clear, runs smooth and
deep, for some distance, when suddenly it is broken by shoals,
miles and miles in length; the current roaring and dashing
among the rocks, with astonishing velocity; so that to navigate
the surging waves, required all the skill and presence of mind
we could muster.</p>

<p>After the Tugalo makes its junction with the Seneca, the
stream takes the name of Savannah, or as the mountaineers call
it&mdash;the Sav-a-naw. Below the mouth of the Seneca, the river
rapidly widens, and the water assumes a yellowish or muddy
color, and it is full of wild and dangerous shoals. The bottoms,
on either side, are wide and well cultivated; but on account of
the fearful freshets, caused by the rising of the mountain streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
above, there are no houses built near the river&mdash;they generally
being from two to three miles back, and sometimes even farther
than that; so that we seldom saw any one, save the slaves, and
their overseers&mdash;the former being the most abject human beings
I ever saw. Occasionally, the overseers themselves were black,
and as far as I could see, they were equally severe on the laborers,
with the white men.</p>

<p>There are no towns at all, immediately on the Savannah,
above Augusta. Occasionally we would meet a keel boat coming
up to the plantations after corn for the rebel army, they being
propelled by poles, and manned by negroes&mdash;the man in
charge occasionally being a white man; usually, however, he
was as black as a crow. Almost every boat contained half a
a dozen rebel soldiers as a guard; and these would sometimes
hail us as we passed; but as they could not stop without "losing
deal" with the current, we would not, for fear of losing deal with
them, and therefore, our conversations were of brief duration.
If we happened to meet on a shoal, they had always as much
as they could do to climb up over it, and we had all we could do
to keep from being dashed to pieces among the rocks, so we
paid little attention to each other.</p>

<p>There appeared to be a continual falling of the river from the
mountains to Augusta; but from there to the coast, I believe
that the stream is exceedingly smooth and placid. Some of the
shoals above, are miles in extent; and each is known to the
keel boatmen by some significant name. Among those which
we deemed from observation to be the most dangerous, are the
Little river shoals, so called because they are just below the
mouth of Little river; the Elizabeth shoals&mdash;but why so called
I am not aware; and the Trotter shoals, named from the fact
that on ascending them with a keel boat, the crew is compelled
to trot with their poles to make headway.</p>

<p>This last named rapid is seven miles long, and is one continuous
hill in the river, down which the current rushes with frightful
velocity, the channel winding back and forth from shore to
shore, while the stream itself winds around, with zigzag curves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and is thickly besprinkled with rocks; so that the water is
lashed into white caps and foam&mdash;the waves rolling short, quick,
and angrily, to an incredible hight.</p>

<p>Another dangerous rapid is the Ring Jaw shoal, not far from
Augusta; the river here being almost dammed up by great
rocks, among which the current forces itself with a short twist,
from right to left, and back again with such power that the passing
boat is nearly wrung in twain, as it proceeds. Another
shoal, about the last in the river, is near the head of the canal,
and is called Bull Sluice, and is somewhat after the fashion of
Ring Jaw, and about as dangerous.</p>

<p>To add to the dangers we encountered in navigating the
stream, we had to run over several mill dams, some of which
were from six to eight feet in perpendicular hight; and
there was but a single method of passing them, and that was to
go over. These dams were invariably built of loose rocks, of
great size, piled on the shoals, sometimes from shore to shore,
but occasionally only forming a wing, partially across. These
mills were almost the only signs of habitation; the structures
being generally strong frames, and they were kept constantly
running; but as they had all been seized by the rebel government,
it was with the greatest difficulty that the people could
get either meal or flour. Still the citizens of this section of
South Carolina lived far better than did those of any other section
of the South which I have visited during the war. They
all seemed to enjoy plenty, and it was of the best quality; but
the white women, as a general thing, were not good cooks&mdash;from
a lack of practice, I presume&mdash;and the negroes were usually too
careless to prepare a meal properly.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXXIII.</i></h2>

<div class="center">BLOODHOUND CHASE&mdash;TAKEN PRISONER&mdash;DRUNKEN AND EXCITED REBELS.</div>


<p>On the night of the 3d of June, 1864, we arrived in Hamburg,
opposite Augusta. The first thing necessary now, was
to see how affairs stood in town, and we accordingly ascended a
hill immediately back of it, where we could see, not only all
that was going on in Hamburg, but much that was transpiring
in Augusta. We secreted ourselves under a dogwood tree,
which was low, and covered with vines, thus forming an excellent
hiding place. If no one passed, and made it a special
business to look in, we were perfectly secure; and at that place
we patiently awaited the approach of daylight. We had learned
on the day previous, that the powder mill was so closely guarded,
that nothing could be accomplished there, so that we directed
our best efforts to the destruction of the bridge.</p>

<p>My plan, before leaving camp, had been to float down under
it in a boat, and throw burning arrows into it, provided I saw no
chance to <i>mug</i> the guard, and do it boldly. At the foot of the
hill we heard a good deal of talking, and could not account for
it; but when it got light enough to see, judge our astonishment
to find ourselves within seventy-five yards of the railroad,
and right before us was a long train loaded with federal prisoners;
while farther down in the town we could see several
other trains of the same kind. The town was full of captured
Union soldiers, and as near as we could guess, there were twelve
hundred rebels guarding them. The situation was most embarrassing;
to stay where we were was almost certain destruction,
and an attempt to go elsewhere would be certain to be discovered.
But the best we could do, was, evidently, to keep
quiet in our hiding place, bad as that was. We hoped that in a
little while the trains would fire up and leave; but on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
they lay there all day. We could see, too, that there was
a strong and vigilant guard upon each end of the bridge; and
we could discover patrols walking the streets in each town, and
in every direction. The prisoners, as usual, looked half starved
and sickly; some were clad in bright, new uniforms, and looked
well, and it was easy to divine that <i>they</i> were only recently captured.
These were in tolerably good spirits, too, which was a
sure sign that they had not been long in the hands of the cruel enemy.
Others, again, were not quite so well dressed, and looked
meager and thin, but were not despondent. These had probably
been prisoners for some months; but by far the greater number
were clothed in rags, which were in the most filthy condition.
They looked very much emaciated and weather-beaten, and their
dejected and hope-forsaken countenances, spoke plainly of a long
and soul-sickening captivity. Poor, wretched, starved, dejected
and sick, they were being moved to that loathsome den, and
wholesale place of murder&mdash;the Andersonville prison. Of course
we did not know their destination for certain, but we judged it
from the fact that all the engines headed west.</p>

<p>It was now clear that we were to be unsuccessful. Nothing
could escape the vigilance of that guard, either on land or on
water. It was positive that we were played out on <i>that</i> string,
and what to get at next, we did not know; and even a chance
of escape at all argued extremely doubtful. We remembered
that on the Tugalo river we had passed under a very fine frame
bridge, for ordinary travel, across the Tugalo; and we thought
we must do something to damage rebeldom, and we therefore
made up our minds to go back and try to burn it, but we had
better have gone straight through to the coast and made our escape,
as I believe we could have done, without detection.</p>

<p>From our place of concealment we could see the arsenal in
Augusta, the powder mill up the river, and nearly every important
building in the place; nevertheless, we dare not move from
our retreat, for fear of being seen. The poor prisoners were
kept under the strictest surveillance, lest they should attempt to
escape, and a great many of them, as we could see, were prostrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and helpless from disease. We almost, ourselves, sickened
at the sight of these poor, suffering men; and at the certainty
that we were powerless to help them. They were crowded
into the cars and on top of them, as thickly as they could be
packed; and to hear the sick pleading for water, was most heart
rending. Poor fellows! some of them would beg until they exhausted
themselves, before it would be given them, and what
added to the cruelty of this neglect, and to the torture of the
men, was the fact that there was plenty of water but a few yards
away.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and long awaited night closed in at last;
and we then stole from our hiding places, and took the road
back up the river. About four miles from Hamburg we "confiscated"
a couple of fine horses&mdash;the property of a man named
Rambo. I am inclined to think we were discovered, just as we
led the horses out of the stable, for I heard some one speak at
the house, though it was after midnight. On the following
morning, we stopped at a blacksmith shop, to have one of the
horses shod; and while there, were overtaken by a pursuing party
of four men, who demanded the animals. I felt confident that
quite a force was after us, and that this was but the advance guard;
and as our object was to gain time, and get into the swamps, and
timber, we gave up the horses, unconditionally, and without
reluctance; saying at the same time that it was very hard to
have to foot it clear back to Franklin.</p>

<p>"What are you going to Franklin for," said the leader of the
party.</p>

<p>"Why, our command is there," I answered, in an off hand
manner.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, in this State," he demanded.</p>

<p>"We are on special service for Col. Thomas."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of your service," he asked.</p>

<p>"O, we are making preparations to move the Indians all over
the mountains, into South Carolina; they are about to starve to
death up there in Qualla town. We are compelled to do something
to keep them from suffering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if you are soldiers, and going back to your command,
we don't want to stop you, but really we can't let you take the
horses," they replied.</p>

<p>It was such a common occurrence for Rebel soldiers to steal
horses, that nothing was ever thought of it, so after recovering
the animals, this party was satisfied to start back. We could
have whipped out the squad, for they were unsuspicious, and
gave us every advantage; but we knew very well that if we did
even kill every one of them, it would do us no good, for the
whole country behind us was now alarmed, and before night it
would be aroused far ahead of us.</p>

<p>As soon as this affair was settled, we took the big road, until
out of their sight, and then turned into the woods. We then
took every precaution to break our trail; wading mile after mile
in swamps, and up creeks, picking our way on rocks and hard
ground; but all to no purpose; for it was only a couple of hours
until we heard the deep mouthed bay of the blood hound,
running on our track. When we heard the dogs, we were laying
down to rest, and had taken off some of our clothing to wring
the water out of them. Hastily putting on our clothes, and
accouterments, we sprang off through the woods, at our highest
speed, practicing every art known to woodsmen, to break our
trail; but we were unsuccessful; the dogs were unerring. At
one time the hounds would be within distinct hearing of us; and
then we would run our very best, until we came to water, and
then wading through, or up, or down it, we would break the
trail so badly that we would balk the hounds for some time; but
occasionally we had to stop to take breath, and then in a brief
time we would hear them coming again. Once we made a large
circle through the woods and doubled on the trail; and this time
we started them to running a back track, and thought we were
rid of them entirely; and as it was late in the afternoon, and
we hoped to escape in the darkness, we rested a few minutes,
and then traveled till nearly dark; when, being tired and
hungry, we concluded that it could not make the matter much
worse to stop at a house and get some supper; but just as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
approached one, we heard the dogs close behind us. We sprang
over the fence, and across a plowed field, and for a while succeeded
in baffling our pursuers. We then crossed two fields, and
gained a dry swamp, the brush and timber being very thick and
dense, so that it was with difficulty that we could make our way
through it; and it was not long till the dogs struck the right
trail, and quickly we heard them crashing through the bush,
close behind us; and we were compelled to make a stand
at once, and fight with dog, or man, or anything that
approached us. On came the hounds, through the thick undergrowth,
making the deep forest echo with their savage baying,
until, with a sudden bound, their leader was upon us, his eyes
glaring, and his mouth foaming. For an instant he paused, as
he saw us through the gloom, and the next made a spring
directly at Gray's face. He was large, and snow white, and this
made him the better target; and as he sprang at my companion,
I turned upon him, and fired, and he fell dead in an
instant. But at that moment the whole pack rushed upon us,
more like demons, than even dogs; and it was with difficulty
that we could see their dusky forms amid the gloom, but their
glaring eyes served as guides for an almost unerring aim; and
when we had discharged nine shots, we had killed one dog and
wounded four more. The flash of the pistols kept the dogs at
bay, wonderfully, but did not drive them off; and scarcely had
we fired the last shot, when the men came up, forcing their
horses through the bushes, cursing and swearing like madmen.
When they got within about a hundred yards of us, we
halted them, saying that if they did not stop, we would fire on
them.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yankee soldiers," I answered.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in our country?" they inquired.</p>

<p>"We are here by order of our General," was the response.</p>

<p>"How many are there of you?" they next wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Two."</p>

<p>"Are you up a tree?" asked one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p>"No; we are not the sort of men to take to trees," we informed
them.</p>

<p>"Have you killed any of our dogs?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, and then whispering to Gray, we moved out toward
them, some distance from the dead animal; then hailing the
men, I said:</p>

<p>"There are but two of us, but we are well armed, and can do
you a great deal of damage, if you drive us to it. We know
that you have a strong force after us, for we have seen you two
or three times to-day; we know that resistance on our part would
only result in useless bloodshed; still it is our privilege to sell
our lives at as dear a price as we can make you pay; but we
don't want to hurt you, nor do we want you to hurt us; and,
therefore, if you will agree to treat us as prisoners of war, we
will surrender without a fight, because we see that one would be
useless."</p>

<p>"You will soon be made to surrender on our terms," was the
response.</p>

<p>"Then approach us at your peril," I answered, "for we intend
to shoot as long as we can crook a finger."</p>

<p>During this parley, another large party had joined the first,
and we could now hear them disputing among themselves, when
presently they hailed us cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Halloo, Yank."</p>

<p>"Halloo yourself," we replied.</p>

<p>"If you will surrender, we will treat you as prisoners of war,
and there shall not one hair of your head be touched," said the
commander of the party.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said I; "on these conditions and no others,
you can have our arms."</p>

<p>I then invited two of their men over to take our weapons, but
they asked that we should fire them in the air first; but I objected,
as evincing a lack of confidence in our honor; but the truth was,
the loads had all been tried on the dogs, but they failed to go,
and I did not want them to know how helpless we were. They
then told us to stand still, and they would all come to us; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
they at once flanked out on both sides to surround us, every now
and then uttering assurances that we should not be hurt.</p>

<p>Finally they approached us direct and demanded the arms;
and while the process of surrendering was going on, Gray, who
was one of the coolest men I ever met, began to crack jokes with
them to give them confidence in our intentions&mdash;inquiring the
"news from Virginia," and asking them what they were going
to feed us on, and if they had any coffee; and on receiving a
negative answer to his last question, he next asked for whisky;
and to this they replied "plenty," and promised us a drink.
But no sooner were our arms delivered, than they changed their
manner. One of them, named Chamberlain&mdash;a Massachusetts
Yankee, as I afterward learned&mdash;swore by his Maker that if we
had shot one of the dogs, he would have retaliated by killing a
man; and at once they commenced looking around among the pack
to see if any of them were hurt; but it was so dark, and the dogs
were so restless, that they were unable to ascertain what damage
was done; nor was it ascertained till next morning.</p>

<p>The party that captured us, after a little parley, got the other
squad pacified and set out on the road to return; and on the way
we stopped at the house where we had intended to take our supper&mdash;the
name of the owner being Serles&mdash;and it is located on
what is known as the river road to Abbeville court house; and
here we were met by another pursuing party, madder and drunker
than either of the others. Indeed it was the most excited and
drunken mob I ever saw; and I never expect to look on its like
again. It required all the address we possessed, to save ourselves
from the infuriated crowd&mdash;seventy-five in number, while
a glance at the dogs, showed that there were thirty-six of them&mdash;a
very respectable force to capture two men. Our surrender
had been made to Lieut. Col. Talbot, and Capt. Burt, commanders
of the party.</p>

<p>Mr. Serles was a gentlemanly old man, and I am persuaded,
did what he could to pacify the crowd. His wife, a good old
lady, also did what she could for, and seemed to sympathize with,
us; but their two daughters were of a different style altogether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
They ran through the excited and drunken crowd, begging and
pleading with the infuriated wretches to hang us, exclaiming:
"Don't let them live, men! don't let them live!" and these expressions
were not without their effect upon our captors. For
once in my life I saw the "<i>secesh</i>" heart thoroughly "<i>fired</i>."
The drunken mob rolled around us with pine-knot torches flickering
in their hands; and the smoke and glare added to the
hideousness of their excited countenances, and gave to the scene
an additionally diabolical appearance.</p>

<p>We told them that if we had to die, it would at least be generous
to give us a good supper, before sending us on our long
journey to the other world; and on hearing this, the old man
Serles walked around among the crowd and invited them to dismount,
and take supper with him; and in this, I could readily
perceive that he was anxious to gain time for us. Looking at
their jaded horses, he took care, further, to remind them that
they had ridden very hard, and were killing their stock; and
added that he had plenty of corn, and that he would take it as a
favor if they would all stop to eat. A number then began to
dismount and feed their horses, while some of them, who had
cooled a little from the effect of passion and whisky, began to
ride off, in twos and threes, to their respective homes. Some
twenty or thirty militiamen remained for supper, keeping a strict
guard over us all the time.</p>

<p>A Col. Harrison who belonged to the party, now took the lead,
and questioned us strictly, but failed to elicit any information
as to the whereabouts of our troops. We were examined separately,
but our stories agreed exactly, as we had conferred
together, and concluded to "plead guilty" of being scouts, in
order to keep down suspicion as to what we really had been
commissioned to do. We had driven our arrow heads all down
in the ground, at Hamburg, when it was discovered that we
should have no more use for them; and when we saw escape
impossible, we threw away everything but our arms and ammunition;
so that nothing was found upon us to cause our real
mission to be detected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the party finished their supper at Serle's house,
and remounted, starting for Col. Talbot's house, ten miles distant;
and this we reached before daylight. Here a part of our
captors left us, and we were turned over to another guard, who
allowed us to lie down in the parlor, and sleep till dawn.</p>

<p>On waking, we saw not one of our captors&mdash;all being gone;
our guards being entirely new men. The whisky bottle was in
circulation, and it was not hard to discover that trouble was brewing.
Fortunately, however, they had not patience to <i>wait</i> to
get drunk, before they attempted to carry out their projects.
It was plain to see that we had been entirely abandoned by those
to whom we had surrendered, and who were in duty bound to
protect us; and that we had been purposely left in the hands of
a party who had made no stipulations; and we therefore prepared
for the worst.</p>

<p>When they roused us up, which they did in a rough, insulting
manner, they told us to get ready to go with them; and as soon
as we raised to our feet&mdash;which it was very difficult for us to do,
on account of the race we had made the day before&mdash;they commenced
to tie Gray with a rope; and after getting him secured
to their notion, they put him under a strong guard. Turning to
me next, they took another cord, and pinioned my arms behind
me as tight as they could draw the rope. It was a severe
operation, and it was performed by a muscular negro, who did it
under compulsion; and when completed, they led me out to a
big tree, in the edge of the woods, taking the negro along, carrying
an extra rope.</p>

<p>When at the tree, they asked me if I had any confession to
make; but I replied I had none to make to <i>them</i>; and they then
said, if I desired to pray, they would allow me a few minutes to
prepare for eternity. I told them that I did not want to pray;
that I was ready to die, and that I did not fear death.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to say?" they asked, with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have a few words to say that may interest you," I
said quietly.</p>

<p>"Out with it," replied their spokesman; and I went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>"You perhaps have never been concerned in military affairs;
you are not soldiers, and have nothing to do with the Confederate
army. You are citizens. You are now about to commit an
act that will meet with the severest punishment that military law
can inflict. We are United States soldiers, acting in discharge
of our duties. You, as citizens, have no right to interrupt us.
Now, I perceive that you are all old men; and have sons in the
Confederate army, perhaps. Our General will retaliate if you
hurt a hair of our heads. If you hang one or both of us, he will
hang man for man. How do you know but he will select some
of your sons. He will be sure to do it if he learns the part you
are taking here; and you will find it impossible to keep him
from discovering this. Then you are all rich men, for I have
heard your talk in the house, and your appearances indicate you
to be men who do not labor. Now we are members of separate
regiments; I belong to the 4th Ohio, and Gray belongs to the
5th Iowa, cavalry. If we are hung, and our regiments ever find
you out, as they will be sure to do, if ever they come into this
country, they will burn every dollar's worth of your property they
can discover; and they will hang every man they can catch who
was concerned in the transaction. If you are prepared to make
this sacrifice, I am."</p>

<p>A little <i>non plussed</i>, they now left me under guard a short
time, and went off into the woods, as I supposed, to talk the
matter over; and when they came back they took me to Talbot's
house again, and untied us both. Talbot then brought out a
decanter of whisky to treat all hands; but in his conversation
he made an insulting remark, to the effect that he wanted to
drink first, as he would rather drink after the blackest nigger he
had than after a Yankee, whereupon we refused to drink with
them.</p>

<p>On the night previous, as they were marching us along, one
villain tried to shoot me in the back; but although the cap
bursted loud and clear, the gun missed fire. He told his companion,
and I overheard him, that his piece was loaded with
twelve buck shot in each barrel; and when he made the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
to fire, he was not more than the length of the horse behind
me.</p>

<p>While Talbot's folks were preparing breakfast for us, they
made an estimate of the distance we had run the preceding
day, reckoning from place to place, and they reached the conclusion
that we had traveled at least eighty miles. I had myself,
already estimated the journey at sixty miles, after we
left our horses, which was at a place eighteen miles from Hamburg.
The time consumed in this trip, was from two o'clock of
one morning, till the same time the next&mdash;twenty-four hours in
all; and it was the roughest day's travel I ever had; it being
doubly severe from the fact that we had to be wet so much,
wading through the swamps to throw the dogs off the trail.</p>

<p>I was much pleased with Talbot's wife. She was a perfect
specimen of a southern lady, in her demeanor, and appeared to
sympathize deeply with us. She was large, and portly, but very
fair; had very long hair, of glossy blackness, and large, brilliant
black eyes, which, when they turned upon us, seemed to be
struggling to speak; and they did speak, though not in words;
for as I watched their deep expression, they seemed to say:
"Poor fellows, I pity, but am powerless to help you!" She presided
at the table and saw that we were bountifully fed.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Chamberlain came up, and he and Talbot
agreed to take us in their buggies, to Edgefield. When Captain
Burt was about to leave, the night before, he whispered to me
that he could do nothing more for us; and that he was afraid
the mob would not let us live; and he further informed us that
men were then scouring the country for the purpose of raising
a crowd to waylay the road for us next morning; so that if we
even escaped death at the hands of the party in charge of us, it
was almost certain we should be taken from them next day, by
men who could not be appeased.</p>

<p>He shook hands with me kindly when he left, and said he was
sorry for us, but he had done all he could do to save our lives,
and keep with us; and that the excited fools were now getting
angry with him. I then thanked him, and he left us. Chamberlain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
manner had altogether changed since his night's sleep.
When he left us he was the most vindictive man in the party;
but now he was one of the most mild, and considerate.</p>

<p>A pair of handcuffs were put on Gray, and he was put in Talbot's
buggy; after which I was securely tied with a rope, and
given over to Chamberlain.</p>

<p>When about to start, Chamberlain asked Talbot which road
they should take&mdash;the upper or the lower; when I turned around
and said:</p>

<p>"You will do us a favor by taking us on the upper one."</p>

<p>He looked at Talbot as if in doubt; but he soon perceived
that I knew the danger, if we went the other way, and Talbot
turned and took the route we desired, and we arrived safely at
Edgefield Court House. On the way, Chamberlain was full of
talk; and I soon perceived that he was a very vain man, and I
plied him so well with "soft soap" that, by the time we reached
Edgefield, he was almost a friend.</p>

<p>The town was full of excited men, and fearing the mob, our
keepers hurried us off to jail, and turned us over to the Sheriff,
until an assistant Provost Marshal could be found; and on entering
the jail we were at once put in solitary confinement; and
in a short time we were separately taken before the Provost
Marshal's agent, who I soon discovered was a consummate villain,
conniving at our seizure by a mob. He was about to refuse
to receive us at all from the militia, but there happened to
be a rebel Lieutenant near, and who said he was on duty there,
and that he would represent the confederacy; and he ordered us
in jail, subject to the orders of the military authorities at Augusta.
Failing to get us to "blow" on each other, or our officers,
they put us in solitary confinement again.</p>

<p>The jail at Edgefield is the strongest one I was ever in in the
South; and that is saying a good deal, as I have been kept in
several, and am therefore competent to judge. We had a sorry
time of it&mdash;the jailor telling us once, that the people outside
were so infuriated, that he feared they would tear the jail open,
and take us out and lynch us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Detectives were employed to quiz, and even lawyers sent to
examine us; but they found out nothing. They got hold of our
journal in cipher, and that gave them the greatest uneasiness,
as they imagined it contained some great military secrets.</p>

<p>About the 9th of June, our cells were thrown open again, and
we were allowed to come out in the light; and then at once
transferred to Captain Dearing, and a guard of twelve well armed
men, whose duty it was to escort us to Augusta. After introducing
himself and stating his business, the Captain informed
us that the citizens were swearing that we should not be taken
from Edgefield alive; but he said that he would take us, nevertheless,
at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>"You shall not be mobbed," said he, "while you are under my
care."</p>

<p>We were heavily ironed, and chained together, and then put
in a wagon, which was driven rapidly away from town before the
crowd of citizens could rally.</p>

<p>It was forty miles to Augusta, and before we had got hardly
away, our mule team broke down, and we had to walk several
miles with our handcuffs and chains, a very fatiguing process;
but aside from this, our guard was kind, and supplied us with
provisions from their rations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="center">THE WHIPPING POST&mdash;TORTURING NEGROES&mdash;STARVING OUR PRISONERS&mdash;THE
CHARLESTON JAIL&mdash;OUR OFFICERS VINDICATED.</div>


<p>At Augusta we were put in close confinement again, under
the tender auspices of a man named Bridges&mdash;a New York
Yankee. He certainly can boast, hereafter, of one thing: the
discovery of the smallest amount of food which is required to
support human life. We were in the jail at Augusta 57 days,
and at the end of that time, were so starved as to be mere
shadows of what we were. I could no longer walk steadily, and
felt as weak as when just beginning to walk after a severe
attack of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, Captain Bradford, the rebel Provost
Marshal, came to see me, and we had a very pleasant conversation.
He said that he used to be a scout in their service, and
had been promoted for meritorious service. He informed us that
our case had been submitted to their Secretary of War, and that
the order was "close confinement during the war." Capt.
Dearing also used to call and see us, once in a while; and the
Catholic priest there, Rev. Father Dugan, once called to see me;
aside from these, we never saw any one but the turnkeys, unless
it was a prisoner, or some one who wanted to see a prisoner,
while we were there. In the cell opposite mine was a man confined
for whipping a negro to death, while in that on my right, was a
negro charged with murder; in a neighboring cell was a Yankee
confined for bigamy; nearly over my head, in the second story,
was a negro woman, held for attempting to poison her mistress;
and somewhere near her was an Italian soldier, in the Federal
service, whom the rebels claimed as a deserter from their army.
The "big room" was filled with rebel deserters, thieves, pickpockets
and all sorts of petty villains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next cell above mine, was an "institution" which has
been a curse to our country, and a disgrace to our own character
as freemen; and an "institution" which has been the witness of
more agonizing torture in the South, than any of us can
imagine&mdash;<i>the whipping post</i>&mdash;that ready means of inflicting
terrible and summary punishment, without any trial or other
law, than the caprice of the master, or mistress. I did not see
this machine, because I never got up there; but managed to
draw an accurate description of it from Luck, a negro, who was
undergoing sentence upon it, and had been whipped upon it
repeatedly. He described it as being made of heavy square
timbers, in the form of a cross; and at the ends of the arms
were iron fetters, made to clasp around the wrist, and hold them
outstretched; and at the bottom were similar irons to secure
the feet. The victim is first stripped naked, then stretched upon
the cross, and made fast, when a turnkey plies a whip, with a
short handle, and a broad heavy strap, punched full of holes for
a lash, and which is, altogether, about two feet and a half long.
The strap strikes flatwise, and wherever there is a hole through
it, a blister raises in the skin; and if it be a heavy blow the
edge of the leather around the openings cuts the skin open,
around the blister, and the wounds bleed profusely.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a day that there was not one whipped,
while I was in that jail; and sometimes there were as many as
six flogged in one day; and generally from three to five. I
have counted the blows at times, and once they numbered one
hundred and eighty-seven, when the punishment was stopped,
by the victim becoming insensible. He must have been a very
robust man, for most generally when they were whipped so
hard, they would faint under from twenty to forty lashes&mdash;according
to the force with which they were laid on. It was
the custom, the turnkey said, for the careful master to stand by,
to regulate that matter to suit himself. I could generally give
a close estimate of the age of the slave they were punishing, by
the sound of the voice. Sometimes the pleading would be heavy
and strong, as though it came from a large man; at other times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
I could hear the wailing cries of a feeble, and sometimes of
a healthy young woman; and occasionally I heard children
screaming under the terrible torture; and once in a while I
would recognize the trembling voice of an old man. Their
struggles would, at times, be almost superhuman, as they
writhed in their iron manacles; and I have often stopped my
ears to shut out their heart-rending supplications for mercy.
This whipping was generally done by a young man named
Evans, a turnkey, and the head jailor Bridges, who, as previously
stated, was originally from New York. The young man, who
was in jail for helping to whip the negro to death, said that they
only struck him eighteen blows; but that after he was let down,
they allowed him to drink too much water, and that killed him.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "they kin stand several hundred, ef you don't
let 'em git too much water, while they are hot."</p>

<p>Filled, as this jail was, with all sorts of villains, guilty of
every degree of crime, it was certainly a hard place for
any man to find himself.</p>

<p>When we had been there fifty-seven days, we were taken by a
Captain Gunn, under a strong guard, to Charleston, and there
turned over to Maj.-Gen. Jones, who, I am sorry to have to
say it, robbed us of two hundred and eighty dollars in Confederate
money. Well, it wasn't much in quantity, and was
worth perhaps less in value, but it really looked mean for a
<i>Major General</i> to steal from us what even the militia allowed us
to keep. At Gen. Jones' quarters, Captain Gunn and guard
left us. They had treated us like gentlemen, and when we were
hungry they divided their own rations with us, for the authorities
gave us <span class="smcap">NONE</span> to travel on. I wonder how they would have liked
their men traveled on empty stomachs? On the train I saw Dr.
Todd, President Lincoln's brother-in-law, and he seemed like a
very clever man and a gentleman. He gave each of us a nice,
light roll and some ham; nevertheless, he was a strong "secesh."
When a command of rebel soldiers began to talk roughly to us,
he would say:</p>

<p>"Come, boys, let us be generous to prisoners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>He had charge, as I learned, of a very large hospital, at or
near Charleston.</p>

<p>Gen. Jones (oh! the villian,) sent us down to Charleston jail,
with orders to have us kept in close confinement, and he allowed
us no liberties whatever. At the jail, the guard turned us over
to the keeper&mdash;one John Simes&mdash;who, though not a very clever
man&mdash;that is, I do not believe he would steal anything he could
not carry off&mdash;had some good traits about him (for what thief
has not)? He put us in the "tower," which is the strongest
part of the building, and the reader can, perhaps, imagine our
feelings, at thus being kept <span class="smcap">FIVE MONTHS</span>, confined under the fire
of our own guns, on Morris Island; the shells bursting around
us constantly, all the time we were there, and when one of the
shells from the huge three hundred pounders would explode in
the vicinity of the jail, it would rock the tower to its foundation.</p>

<p>In a few days after we were incarcerated in this place, twelve
hundred of our officers were brought to the city, to be put under
fire of our own guns, in retaliation for the shelling of the city;
and among them, was Lieut. Henry, of my own regiment, who
had been captured at the battle of Chickamauga, and with him
was Major Beatty, of the 2d Ohio infantry, and from them I obtained
a knife and a small file, to make some keys with, for the
purpose, if possible, of making my escape. I had intimated my
desire to them, and they tossed the instruments into my cell,
through the grating, as they were going up into the drum of the
tower to sleep.</p>

<p>I saw them once, after, for a few minutes, "on the sly," and
learned that they had been brutally treated, as had been all their
comrades, since the battle of Chickamauga.</p>

<p>In my prison were about thirty colored soldiers, belonging to
the 54th Massachusetts infantry, who had been captured in the
attempt to storm Fort Wagner. Poor fellows! they had a
sorry time of it, as the rebels had a particular spite at them;
and some of their number, I learned, had been sent off to the
country, to men who claimed them as slaves. One&mdash;a fine looking
fellow, named George Grant&mdash;had so far gained the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
of the rebels, that he was made a sort of turnkey over
the prison; and he succeeded in getting a Union woman to
bring him a piece of thick brass for us to work into keys. It
was a piece of stair carpet bar, and was just the thing we wanted.
Through a man named Leatherman, I got a note to Lieut.
Stokes, of the navy, and requested him to write to my father,
and let him know how and where I was. Stokes had been
brought to the place for exchange; and I will take occasion here
to say that I have it in my power to vindicate our officers from
the charges so often brought against them by our enemies, of
not caring for the welfare of the soldiers, and that they were
selfish, and ambitious, and were indifferent as to what became of
us, if they only could get place and power, and were able to
make money out of the war. Here was an officer of another
arm of the service than that to which I belonged, who had
never seen me before, who knew nothing in the world of me,
but who interested himself deeply in my case; for as soon as he
was exchanged, he wrote the following letter to my father at
Hillsboro, Ohio:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">"New York</span>, October 26th, 1864.</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I have just returned from the South, a paroled prisoner. While
I was confined in Charleston, S. C., I saw your son, James Pike, who was
in solitary confinement in the jail, together with his comrade Charles Gray,
and was able to correspond with them. They told me they were captured
near Augusta, Ga., in uniform, and under arms, and on "special duty" for
General Thomas; and also wished me to write to you when I was released,
and tell you that he was quite well and in good spirits; but they were
looking rather pale, poor fellows, from their long imprisonment and short
rations of food. I was kept in the jail yard, while they were in the building.
I communicated by means of a negro boy who carried water to them.</p>

<p>"I promised them when I got out, I would do all I could for them. I
have just written to Col. Mulford, Assistant Agent of Exchange, and to
Gen. Thomas in their behalf. I can not promise they will be able to effect
your son's release, but they will do all they can, I think.</p>

<p>"I had an interview with Col. Mulford on the flag-of-truce boat coming
down the James River, and he told me to make the statement in writing,
and it would receive attention.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>
<p>"I saw your son last on or about the 6th of this month. I trust, sir, he
may soon be restored to you. I am, respectfully,</p>

<div class="right">
"Your obedient servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Thomas B. Stokes</span>,<br />
"Acting Ensign, U. S. N."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter was received on the 4th of November; but my
father had previously written to the War Department, and received
the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">War Department, Washington City</span>,<br />
"October 5th, 1864.
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;Your communication of the 28th ultimo has been received, and
I am instructed to inform you, in reply thereto, that the Department will
use all the means in its power to effect the release of your son, Corporal
James Pike, of the 4th Regiment Ohio Cavalry, now held in confinement,
as you state, at Charleston, South Carolina.&mdash;Very respectfully,</p>

<div class="right">
"Your obedient servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Louis H. Pelouze</span>,<br />
"Ass't. Adjutant-General.<br />
</div>
<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Pike</span>, Washington C. H., Ohio."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Gen. Grant he also received the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Headquarters Armies of the United States</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">City Point, Va.</span>, October 24th, 1864.
</div>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Pike</span>, Washington, Ohio:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I am directed by Lieut-General Grant to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of September 28, and to say that he perfectly recollects the
services rendered by your son. In regard to an exchange, Gen. Grant
hopes during the coming winter, or perhaps earlier, to be able to effect the
liberation of all our soldiers now in the hands of the enemy.&mdash;I am, sir,
very respectfully,</p>

<div class="right">
"Your obedient servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Adam Badeau</span>,<br />
"Lieut-Col. and Mil. Sec."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The man who, above all others, has always been most systematically
abused, is General Butler. He has ever been represented
by his enemies as a cold-hearted tyrant in his dealings
with our soldiers, and has been constantly blamed by the rebels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
with retarding all their pious (?) efforts to effect speedy exchanges;
but the following letter completely vindicates him from
such slanders, if nothing else would:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Headquarters Dep't of Virginia and North Carolina</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Office Commissioner for Exchange</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Fort. Monroe, Va.</span>, Dec. 18th, 1864.
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;In reply to your communication of November 14th, the commanding
General directs me to inform you that he has ordered a rebel
prisoner, now in Fort Delaware, to be held a hostage for your brave and
gallant son.</p>

<p>"The prisoner is of the same rank as your son, and is to be subjected to
the same treatment as your son receives at the hands of the rebels.</p>

<p>"He sympathizes deeply in his sufferings, and hopes by these means he
may soon be released.&mdash;Very respectfully,</p>

<div class="right">
"Your obedient servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Henry H. Bennett</span>,<br />
"Private Secretary.<br />
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Pike</span>, Esq., Washington C. H., Ohio."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My father also received a very kind letter from Gen. Thomas,
promising to render me all the assistance in his power; and the
correspondence ought to satisfy any one, that our officers, so far
from neglecting my interests, were really bestowing more attention
to my case than I deserved; nor do I believe they ever
neglected the interests of any soldier whose situation was properly
brought to their notice. But to return to my narrative,
after this digression.</p>

<p>We remained in Charleston jail for five months, and during
that time I communicated with a Georgian, named Jim Robinson,
who agreed, that if we could make the keys, he would show
us a sewer under the tower, leading out beyond the prison walls
and the guards; and with this understanding we labored for weeks,
making in all about thirty different keys, out of tin, bone, etc.,
besides eighteen out of brass. These latter were filed so as to
fit the locks, and with them we were enabled to open every door
leading to the sewer. We then opened the cell doors, and let
the Georgian out during two successive nights; but each time,
when he got out, he was seized with fear, and, trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
would excuse himself, promising go if we would wait another
night; but in the meantime he communicated the whole affair to
the jailor, who searched for the keys, and found them in Grant's
cell.</p>

<p>In prospecting about to get the keys, they seized Grant by
the throat to frighten him; but he struck the traitor Robinson
with a large pocket knife, and cut him through the instep of one
of his feet. After this failure we were too closely watched to
get any chance to escape, and so had to "sweat it out" as long
as the rebels could keep us in that jail.</p>

<p>Our rations were a pint of meal, and half a pound of meat per
day, and when we failed to get the former, we had rice or cow
peas dealt out in their stead. Much of the time, however, we
failed to get meat, and often our meal would be so musty that
we could scarcely swallow it, although always ravenously hungry.
The rations were always cooked for us, and brought once
a day; and we had our choice either to eat them up at once, or
set part of them aside. We could not, however keep it long, as
the foul air in the cells would spoil the best of food in a few
hours; and we, therefore, speedily acquired the habit of eating
but once a day. The quantity of food given us, to tell the truth,
was not more than sufficient for one light meal.</p>

<p>The Sisters of Mercy came to see us, after they found out our
condition, as often as the jailor would allow them to do so, or as
they could find time. They always brought some little delicacy,
and to them we were indebted for about all the medicine we got.
We were badly afflicted with scurvy, and they sent us potatoes
and vinegar, which nearly cured us; while a priest&mdash;Father John
Moore&mdash;supplied us with books, thereby giving us an opportunity
to spend our time profitably and agreeably. We were enabled
to get light enough to read, provided the sky was clear, by
sitting at the grating door, which we were allowed to do four or
five hours each day; but if the sky was shrouded in clouds, the
gloom of the tower was like that of a dungeon.</p>

<p>In cell No. 8 was a Union man named Webb, in No. 10, an old
fisherman, and in No. 11, an Irishman, all of whom had been incarcerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
for aiding our officers to escape; and it was through
Mrs. Webb that the Sisters of Mercy heard of us.</p>

<p>During the first sixty days of our imprisonment we could get
no water with which to wash our clothing; and during the entire
Winter we slept on the floor without covering, but a short time
before we left Webb was released, and he gave us his blanket,
and a Mrs. Trainor got an opportunity to smuggle in another
one. The jail, too, was literally swarming with vermin, and to
add to our discomfort, the inmates of the jail were keeping up a
continual noise, so that rest was nearly impossible. In addition,
when the air was full of fog or clouds, the inner work of the jail
was always streaming with water, which collected on them, and
which caused the floors to be continually damp.</p>

<p>The cell in which we were confined so long had a front of
eleven feet, with a rear six feet four inches broad, in the tower,
and its width was also six feet four inches; and often, for weeks
together, we were not allowed to step beyond the doors of this
narrow cage.</p>

<p>But why add more relative to the horrors of this filthy pen?
He who has never experienced the torture of a Southern prison-house
can form no idea of the wretchedness inclosed; while the
tens of thousands who have been incarcerated therein, but who
have been fortunate enough to escape death, need no words that
they may appreciate the cruelties inflicted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<div class="center">ADIEU TO CHARLESTON&mdash;ESCAPE FROM THE REBELS&mdash;ARRIVAL IN THE UNION
LINES.</div>


<p>"It is a long lane that has no turn," says an old adage; and
our captivity, like all things earthly, came to an end. When
Gen. Sherman moved upon Branchville, the evacuation of Charleston
became a military necessity; and when the rebels left the
city, Gray and myself were sent to the jail at Columbia, the
capital of South Carolina. The presence of Sherman's army
appears to have almost worked a miracle, for from the time we
were lodged at Columbia, we received the best possible treatment.
Our keeper was Capt. Semmes, whose whole conduct toward us
was that of a gentleman, though a bitter rebel; and I got along
finely, except in a single instance.</p>

<p>We were put in a room in which there were about twenty-five
persons, twenty-one of them being deserters from our army, and
the remainder prisoners of war. Of course, we could never
agree with the deserters; and they put at me to convert me to
their "faith," or rather lack of faith, which occasioned me to insult
them, and for this I was soundly whipped for it in less
than three minutes. I was not strong enough to fight them, for
they were just from the north, and had been well fed and were
in good health; while I had been shut up so long on short allowance
and unwholesome food, that I had little strength left; nevertheless
I went in whenever opportunity offered, and always came
out second best. Fearing if ever I got north again I would report
them, they concluded to take time by the forelock, and
reported me to the rebels as a spy; and either Capt. Semmes or
his Lieutenant, gave an order that my hair should be cut off as
a punishment: and accordingly four of them seized me and held
me down, while a fellow named Jim Brown, a deserter from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
31st Illinois, hacked off my hair. This miscreant is a man about
six feet high, with dark hair and eyes, and swarthy complexion&mdash;a
very talkative man&mdash;and, I believe, a fiddler. He was raised in
the Sequatchie valley, in Tennessee, but for several years has
been living in Franklin county, Illinois; and he, together with
the whole vile crowd, took the oath of allegiance to the Southern
Confederacy, and were sent back north as a reward for their
rascality. They should forever be excluded from society for
their crimes.</p>

<p>When Gen. Sherman's army invested Columbia, the rebels took
us out of jail, and put us under fire of our own guns; but what
for, we did not know. There were about sixty of us altogether,
and among the number was the Colonel of the 1st Georgia Federal
regiment; also a Capt. Harris, of the 3d Tennessee Cavalry,
who had been in close confinement for two years and a half&mdash;heavily
ironed all the time; and during the whole period had
been kept in one room, outside of which he had never been.</p>

<p>While we were under fire, a piece of one of our Rodman shells,
weighing about five pounds, struck me on the left shoulder; but
as it was a glancing blow, it did no other damage than to stiffen
my arm a little.</p>

<p>That night (I believe it was the 17th or 18th of February),
the rebels started us off for Winnsboro, to put us on a train and
run us to Salisbury, North Carolina. This was the first time
they had tried to do anything with us on foot; and about three
miles from Columbia, as we were going down a hill, where on the
left hand side of the road there was a bluff several feet high,
almost perpendicular, Gray sprang down the bank and escaped
to the woods. The rebels fired about twenty shots at him; but
I afterward saw him, and he told me that although several balls
cut close, none of them touched him; and he told me that he got
to the Congaree river, and swam over it next morning to our
army.</p>

<p>I went on with the rebels till the next night, and then I left
them; and the way I escaped was this: we had been marching
hard all day, and at night all hands were very tired. We only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
had one skillet for the whole party to bake bread in, and I rose
about two o'clock in the morning and began to cook. After
awhile I wanted wood, and going up to the dead line with an ax
on my shoulder, I got permission from the guard to step over to
a tree top that lay just at their feet to supply myself. They
thought, I suppose, that I would not attempt to get off, and they
allowed me this small privilege; I had struck but few blows
with the ax before they turned their heads to watch the other
prisoners; and as that was my only chance, I was off at once,
and made the best time I ever did. After running about three
hundred yards, I halted and looked around; but I had not yet
been missed, and I then felt perfectly safe. I took the best
course I could through a swamp and wood, and then struck out
for Columbia. I did not, however, proceed far before I came in
sight of camp fires; and immediately I commenced a reconnoisance.
Stealing close to their pickets, I discovered rebel cavalry,
and away I went once more through the woods, like a race
horse&mdash;keeping all the time, however, in sight of the camp fires;
for I knew that if I followed their direction, I would soon pass
the rear-guard of the rebel army and stand a chance to fall in
with our own troops.</p>

<p>It was not long before daylight overtook me, and I was obliged
to conceal myself in a little cane-brake, in a narrow
swamp. When I entered it I felt sure that nothing but an accident
would save me from discovery; but there was no other
chance, and into it I went, waist deep in water. After traveling
about a considerable time, I discovered a place which afforded
as much security as, and a little more comfort than, any
other; and after arranging the brush I laid down on a little
knoll of dry earth to rest.</p>

<p>From my hiding place I could distinctly see a brigade of rebel
cavalry, encamped on a hill but three-quarters of a mile from
me; and from the arrangement of the camp I knew it was on
some road. All day long, not daring to move, I laid and shivered
in my hiding-place; and at one time a number of soldiers
approached near me, while driving out cattle from the brake&mdash;eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of them coming within a few feet of where I laid; but I
was not discovered.</p>

<p>That night I struck the railroad, and traveled&mdash;sometimes near
and sometimes on it&mdash;as my judgement dictated most prudent,
until I was at length interrupted by a body of water, which I
took for a river. The railroad bridge over it was very high, but
was in flames and rapidly falling down; so I crept up to it to
consider the chances of crossing the stream. I saw a picket
post about a hundred yards from the stream, but there appeared
to be no guard at the bridge itself; so I hastened up to it,
mounted the lower timbers, which did not appear to be on fire,
and on them I made my way nearly across, when I discovered
that a portion of them had already been burned out, so that I
was compelled to go back again, and I was fortunate enough to
escape detection, and was soon once more in the woods.</p>

<p>Near the bridge, at a mill, were three hundred rebel cavalry;
and just above were camp-fires enough for a division of infantry.</p>

<p>Before I struck the railroad, I slipped up to a house to inquire
something about the country; for I did not know for certain
that I was traveling in the right direction to strike our
troops; but I was under the impression that Sherman had taken
Columbia, and was therefore aiming for that point. Creeping
quietly up to this house, I was just about to rouse the inmates,
when a man on the opposite side shouted:</p>

<p>"Halloo, the house;" and in a minute he was answered by a
woman.</p>

<p>"We want," said he, "to get some feed for our horses; we
have been riding all day, and our stock is very tired and hungry,
and if you have any corn or fodder we want to get it."</p>

<p>The woman asked what they belonged to, and they answered:
"Wheeler's cavalry."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," she said, "we have no corn or fodder, only
what we buy and pay the money for. We did not raise any this
year; our crop failing entirely. If we let you take what we
have on hand we will have to pay out more money to replace it,
and that would be rather hard, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, yes, madam;" was the reply, "we know that; but you
might as well let us have it as the Yankees. They will be along
here to-morrow and take every thing from you they can find."</p>

<p>This was news to me&mdash;just what I wanted to learn.</p>

<p>"Are the Yankees that near?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam; they are not more than two miles in the rear
of our army now, and will be along here sure, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought they were away the other side of Columbia,"
responded the woman.</p>

<p>"O, no; they captured Columbia day before yesterday," said
one of the party.</p>

<p>"Well, if that is the case," she answered, "you can take all
the corn and fodder we have got. You will find it down at the
barn."</p>

<p>Now the barn was almost behind me; and when the woman
told them where the forage was they started instantly for it.
Just on my right hand was a low shed, that had been built to
shelter sweet potatoes, which had been buried under it; and the
hills were covered with pine boughs, which made it very dark
under the roof; and as it looked like a good hiding-place, I
dodged down there, but fell headlong on an old sow with a litter
of young pigs, and some half a dozen full-grown shoats. Here
was a rather unpleasant situation! The hogs, alarmed and indignant
at the unceremonious intrusion, made a great noise, of
course; and, as they rushed out, they threw down a part of the
shanty on my head.</p>

<p>I now laid myself down flat on my face, in one of the ditches,
alongside of a sweet potato "hole," and hoped to escape detection;
but that hope was a fallacious one. Scarcely had I
straightened myself in the ditch before two enormous dogs
leaped over the fence and made directly for me. There was no
time to lose, I thought, and I sprang from under the shed and
was off, like a race-horse, over the white sand; nor did I stop
to look behind until I had cleared three fences.</p>

<p>On turning around, finally, I discovered the rebels at the
barn, some dismounted, but others on their horses looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
me, as if exceedingly anxious to discover my whereabouts; but
none of them attempted a pursuit. Nor would it then have been
any use, as I had reached the edge of the brush, through which
they could not have ridden. I suppose they believed me one of
their own men, as their camps were so near.</p>

<p>After my attempt to cross the burning bridge, I picked my
way around a great swamp, and came to a large plantation; and
hoping that I might get a boat to cross the supposed river, before
daylight, I went to the house, which was not more than a
quarter of a mile from the largest camp I had seen; but
when I reached it, I looked up and thought daylight was approaching
and I must secrete myself till the following day,
when I felt sure our army would pass by and I could join it.</p>

<p>I looked all around, and the best hiding-place I could discover
was under the house; so I laid down on the ground and rolled
over and over till I got to the chimney, where I thought I was
pretty well secured from observation, and then fell asleep.
Presently, however, some one in the house began to stir the fire,
and that waked me up; and, on looking about, I saw immediately
above me a wide opening in the floor, so that the inmates
of the house could certainly see me if I remained where I was;
and of course I had to "evacuate" the position.</p>

<p>When I got out daylight still appeared no nearer, and I consequently,
concluded I must have been mistaken, and I therefore at
once determined to rouse the people, and stand off in the dark
and talk to them, and learn what I wanted about the country
and the armies. First, however, it was necessary to reconnoiter
the position, and I went to the end of the house, where I found
a little hole in the window, which was curtained. Through this
hole I thrust a finger, and was enabled to gradually remove
the curtain so as to see the fire-place; and there was an old
darkey down on his knees, with his back to the fire and his
breast resting on a low stool. He was very old and very
fleshy; and he evidently had not been to bed that night. I
wondered at this, and went around to the door and opened it
very gently and put my head into the room, which contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
two beds, in each of which were two white men. On the posts
were gray coats, and at the head of each bed were two guns,
and on one was a saber; so regarding this as a rather dangerous
place, I did not pursue the "reconnoissance" further, and I
closed the door and left.</p>

<p>On the other side of the yard a light was streaming through
the window of a negro house, and I went over and peeped in
and found a black man sitting by the fire, half asleep; but with
a low "whistle" I brought him to his feet as quickly as if he
had been bitten by a rattle-snake, and I at once called him, in a
whisper, to the window. I told him I was a Yankee soldier in
great distress; that I wanted to come in and warm myself, for
I was nearly frozen, and adding that I was very hungry.</p>

<p>"You can't come in heah, sah," said he; "my boss is in de
nex' room wid four or five soldiers, an' if dey ketch you, fore
God, dey kill you."</p>

<p>"Can you not, then, give me something to eat?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ain't got a bite cooked, sah; soldiers dun tuk all we had,
sah," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then, you can tell me a good place to go and hide, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Right down dar, sah; across dat ole fiel'; dar's an ole house
you can go an' git inter."</p>

<p>I only asked him the question to make him believe I was going
in one direction, when I would strike out in the contrary
one as soon as I was out of his sight.</p>

<p>From this plantation I continued to follow the course of the
water I wanted to cross, and in a short time I came to another
plantation. In each corner of the yard at this place, there was
a large log cabin standing; and selecting the one I judged to be
occupied by the blacks, I approached it, and knocked at the door,
and almost instantly a huge house-dog came bouncing at me
from the other building; and as I thought there might be rebel
soldiers sleeping there, I declined an engagement with the animal,
and ran off down to the stables, and climbed up in a loft,
after which the dog returned to the house, apparently well satisfied
with his exploits.</p>

<p>As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
soon as he became quiet, I got down and stole up to the
house again, and softly opening the door, went in. The first
thing I now did was to feel around over the beds to see if any
one was sleeping in the house; but they were all empty. I then
examined the table and cupboard, trying to discover something to
eat, but found nothing. Then I stirred the ashes to see if I could
raise fire enough to warm and dry myself, and while doing this, I
heard some one in the other house opening the door. Knowing
that it is always best to meet danger half way, I went out into
the yard, and as soon as I showed myself, was challenged by a
female voice from the porch.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in my house at the dead hours of the
night?" she fairly screamed.</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy, madam," I said calmly, for I was afraid
she would alarm the camp which was within easy hearing
distance.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she screamed again.</p>

<p>"I am a soldier, madam, and I want to come in your house,
and warm myself."</p>

<p>By the time I said this I was close enough to see her, and discovered
that she had on no article of dress but one of those
short-sleeved, low-necked garments, made of muslin, which I have
often seen on clothes-lines, while in her right hand she had a
vicious-looking rifle, and she looked angry enough to use it. I
now determined, if possible, to get near enough to snatch the
gun from her, if she made any attempt to shoot. As I drew
close enough for her to see the color of my clothing, she hallooed
out:</p>

<p>"You're a <i>Yankee</i>, that's what you are!"</p>

<p>"No, madam," I answered, "you are very much mistaken; I
am no Yankee, I am a Texan."</p>

<p>"Well, what were you doing in my house this time of night;
why didn't you come to the house we live in; what did you go
there for? you might have known there was nobody in there."</p>

<p>"Madam, I am a stranger; how should I know which house
you were in?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what do you want here, this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Why, I want to come in and warm, and get something to
eat, for I am hungry, and very cold and wet."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go over there to the camp, and get something
to eat?' she asked; "haven't they got plenty over there?"</p>

<p>"Madam," I said solemnly, "there are men over there who
have not had a bite to eat for three days."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" she asked in a relenting tone, and I saw at
once that I had gained the point I wanted&mdash;her sympathy.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, that is true, and for my part, I have been wandering
about all night to find something to eat; but the boys all
said they had nothing, or else that they couldn't spare it, so I
came off over here."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" she said, "why, I didn't know our soldiers
were so hard up as that."</p>

<p>"Madam, I must come in and warm," I said; "for I am really
freezing," and suiting the action to the word, I started in.</p>

<p>"Well, wait," she said, half scared, "till I make a fire, and you
may come in."</p>

<p>In a few moments she had a bright fire of fat pine blazing,
and she called me in. She had also put her clothes on, and
wrapped a shawl around her. I sat by the fire some time and
warmed, when she called to a younger woman, and told her to
go out in the kitchen and find me something to eat. In a little
while she returned, bringing a large, "flat cake" of corn bread
and a piece of raw bacon, which she gave me, and I proceeded
to appease my appetite. When I got through eating, I resumed
the conversation with,</p>

<p>"Madam, these are troublesome times, and these are days
when we all need friends; you, perhaps, need friends, and so do
I. You befriend me to-night, to-morrow I may have it in my
power to help you."</p>

<p>"Why," said she, "what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Madam," I replied, "I don't believe you could find it in your
heart to injure me, and so I shall make a confidant of you, for
I need your assistance. I am a United States soldier."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>"There now," she said, in an excited tone, "I said you were a
Yankee, and you told me, no. Oh! just think! what if some of our
soldiers should step in; and a body never knows when to look for
them. What <i>did</i> bring you so close to the camp? Why if they
should catch you here they would kill you, and may be me, too;
at least, they would take every thing I had in the world. Oh!
if I had known you were a Yankee, I wouldn't have let you
come in."</p>

<p>"Madam, I am no Yankee;" I answered, "I am a western
man; I told you no lie."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are the same thing; you know we call all your
men Yankees; that is the only way we always speak of your
men in our country."</p>

<p>"Well, madam, you help me to-night, and to-morrow I may
be able to do you a favor."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"' she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, all that I want now, is for you to tell me how to get
over this river down here," pointing in the direction of the
water.</p>

<p>"Why, bless your soul, that is no river; it's nothing but a
mill pond. Where do you want to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I want to go to Columbia, or to the nearest camp of Sherman's
army."</p>

<p>"Well, I can put you in a path that will take you out on the
Columbia road," said she; and without more ado about it, she
went out some distance from her house, and showed me a path,
by following which through the fields, woods, around a swamp,
and over a ridge, I would eventually come to a big road that led
to Columbia.</p>

<p>I thanked her, and she asked me my name, and told me she
was a lone widow, and her name was Mary Jones; and she certainly
was young and beautiful as one could wish. I followed
her directions to the letter, and found the big road she described;
but lo! there was a big cavalry camp on it. I picked my way
around this, well satisfied that the woman did not know they
were there; so I struck out across woods, and plantations, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the direction I wanted to go, and was soon so far from the camp
that I believed myself safe, and traveled in daylight, though I
still kept off the road.</p>

<p>I was making very good time across a piece of low swampy timber
land, to a ridge, a short distance before me, when all of a
sudden, I heard sharp skirmishing on the top of the very hill
I wanted to reach, and knowing our men were there, I was sure
that all I had to do was to conceal myself till the rebel rear
guard was drawn back, and I soon found a hiding place in a tree
top near by. Covering up my blue clothes in the green boughs
a while, I found the skirmish had ended, but still the rebels did
not pass me, as I expected, and I therefore came out and started
on my journey, and soon found our infantry tearing up the railroad
at a rapid rate. I was now free once more, after a long and
tedious captivity! Those who have never been captives, can
little appreciate the feelings of one in my situation at that time.
The sight of friends, and of the old flag, and the prospect of
soon again being able to revisit home and friends, called up feelings
too deep for utterance, too intense for description.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>

<div class="center">THE NORTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGN&mdash;DOWN TRIP TO WILMINGTON&mdash;AT SEA&mdash;DISCHARGED
FROM THE SERVICE.</div>


<p>On reaching our camp, I reported to Col. Fairchild, who
treated me with great kindness, and sent me, as soon as I was
well rested and refreshed, to Columbia, which place I reached at
night, and on the following morning I reported to Gen. Sherman.
He was just marching out of town when I found him, and he
appeared highly gratified at my escape, and expressed a hope
that Gray would reach him all right. He then sent me to Gen.
Kilpatrick's command, to get a horse and outfit, which was soon
obtained, among which was a Spencer rifle&mdash;the latter given me
by Col. Starr, of the 2d Kentucky Cavalry.</p>

<p>It was not long before I had an opportunity to "see service"
once more. Capt. Northrop, of Kilpatrick's scouts, went with
his men to Wadesboro, North Carolina, and although there were
but about thirty of us, we charged the place without hesitation,
and drove out about two hundred rebels. It was a gallant little
fight, but our Lieutenant was killed&mdash;the only man hurt in the
engagement, on our side. We captured a great many prisoners,
horses, and negroes, which we carried back to the camp.</p>

<p>A day or two after this affair, Wade Hampton mustered up
pluck enough to give Gen. Kilpatrick battle. Early in the morning
the Johnnies charged on our pickets, on every road leading to
camp; but when they met the main body of our cavalry, they got
handsomely repulsed.</p>

<p>When Gen. Sherman reached Cheraw, I went there, in
obedience to orders, to carry dispatches to certain points, within
the enemy's country. I traveled with the army, to Laurel Hill,
in North Carolina, when the General started me from that place
on the 8th of March, in the night, to go to Wilmington, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
dispatches for Gen. Terry, who was in command at that place.
It was raining hard, and intensely dark, when I left camp; and,
as might have been expected, I got lost in the first swamp I came
to, and wandered around till morning, without getting anywhere;
but finally brought up at Gen. G. A. Smith's tent, in another part
of the swamp.</p>

<p>Being exceedingly tired, and sleepy, I arranged some rails by
his camp fire, and laid down to rest. When I did so the ground
was dry; but when the General woke me up, I found the water
four inches deep, all around the rails. He then gave me a good
breakfast, and a pass, as the "bummers" were not familiar
with Gen. Sherman's chirography, and had arrested me on the
previous night. Some of them even seemed to doubt the
General's ability to write, urging as a reason for their opinion,
that they had never seen anything he had written. I talked to
them, but they were inexorable, and I was compelled to go back
to a picket partly to prove my identity.</p>

<p>Gen. Smith gave me a horse to ride to the river, and I then
made good time. Twelve miles above the mouth of Rock Fish
creek, I stole two negroes, and a boat, and abandoned my horse;
and at dark I was at the mouth of the creek, on Cape Fear river,
down which I proceeded rapidly. This is not a wide stream,
until it passes Wilmington; but it was very high at that time,
and the current was swift; and below the mouth of Rock Fish,
as far as the town of Elizabeth, it is the straightest natural
water course I ever saw; indeed it was almost as straight as a
canal.</p>

<p>My contrabands worked very hard at the paddles, for they
knew that I was going to make them free, as soon as they
reached Wilmington; and we got along remarkably well, considering
the fact that it was extremely dark. We came near
being stove to pieces several times, by snags, and once were
caught in an eddy, in the middle of which was a whirlpool&mdash;an
ugly place, in which we came near being drawn under. We labored
assiduously, however, with all our strength, and finally succeeded
in escaping, but our boat was nearly full of water, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
strength almost exhausted. Although the largest whirlpool I
ever saw, I do not think it is always there, but is the result of
an extraordinarily high water, sweeping by the curve in the
bank.</p>

<p>When daylight overtook us, we pulled ashore, and hid ourselves
and went to sleep, thinking we had passed the town of
Elizabeth, which was the only point on the river at which we
anticipated danger; but when it got entirely light, we discovered
that the place was yet a little below us, and on the opposite
bank. If we remained where we were, in close proximity to the
town, we knew that detection was certain; and I therefore got
my black crew on board again, and dropped down a little, to the
mouth of a creek, and then pulled into it; and we soon found it
widened into a timber swamp, and in this we hid our boat, and
then took ourselves to what we deemed a secure place. We were,
however, soon astonished to find ourselves within a stone's throw
of a rebel camp; but there was now no help for us, and we were
compelled to do the best we could. The town, also, which was
in full view, was full of rebel soldiers, and refugees; and these,
to add to our unpleasant feelings, were constantly engaged in
running off stuff and hiding it in the very swamp in which our
boat was concealed. There was, also, on our own side of the
river, a body of cavalry and infantry, some eight or nine
hundred altogether&mdash;and two pieces of artillery; but the latter
were taken away during the day.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these difficulties, we escaped detection,
but were obliged to abandon our boat, and take to the woods,
which we did as soon as it was dark. Our course was up the
creek, and through the woods, until we concluded we were far
enough away to have no more to fear from the rebel camp, when
we struck out, and soon came upon a big road, where we crossed
the creek or rather swamp, on a big log; but only to find ourselves
on an island, and in the midst of a company of rebel
infantry. Men were passing, and repassing; and near us, were
at least a dozen brilliant camp fires. We at once threw ourselves
flat on the ground, to study what we should do; and while laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
there, a company of cavalry passed so near us, that we might have
touched their horses "with a ten foot pole."</p>

<p>"Now is our chance," I whispered to my negroes, as I heard
the horses splashing through the water, while some of the men
were swearing. We immediately bounded up, ran to the log, and
crossed, immediately behind the cavalry, and when we cleared
the water, we sprang for the brush, and were soon out of sight.
I was sure that if we were seen by the infantry, they would
conclude that we belonged to the cavalry, and had dismounted
for some purpose; and if the cavalry observed us, they would
take us for infantry men, and pay no attention to us. However,
I do not think they saw us at all.</p>

<p>We now made a wider circuit around the town, and by dint of
exertion and much wading, accompanied by enormous fatigue,
we reached the river bank again, two miles below the place.</p>

<p>At the next plantation, we got a negro guide to pilot us across
another swamp that was very deep, and could only be crossed
with difficulty in a boat, as it was fully a mile wide and densely
timbered all the way. He landed us at an old road which was
now out of use, and took us a mile or so further to a ferry, where
we stole another boat, and went on our way rejoicing. We now
traveled as fast as we could paddle our bateau, until within about
twenty-five miles of Wilmington, where we met with the gun-boat
Eolus, which we hailed and were taken on board.</p>

<p>About three hundred yards above where I got on board, she
stopped and captured four rebels who were in a bateau trying
their best to escape her, and who appeared to have been following
us; but of that I am not certain. I reported to the captain,
whose name was Young, that I was carrying dispatches for Gen.
Sherman. He was delighted to hear from the interior, and was
ready to afford me any assistance in his power. The men
crowded around me, and for a few minutes I was besieged with
questions about the welfare of the army, and the nature and extent
of its achievements; and then hurrying me down into the
hold, they quickly had me rigged out in clean clothes&mdash;shirts,
drawers and socks&mdash;and they were hunting for pants, blouse and
hat, when the "dinkey" was lowered to the water, and the captain
gave me a letter and told me my craft&mdash;which was his own
light boat&mdash;was ready. I was surprised when I found that the
Eolus had carried me fourteen miles up the river again in the
little while I had been aboard of her; but our boat ran very light,
and we soon regained the distance. As we had been fasting
nearly two days, her hospitality was well timed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i388.jpg" width="900" height="515" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"The boys went in with a spirit which was irresistible, and the Johnnies either fell before their unerring Spencer rifles,
or retreated in shameful disorder amid the cheers of our gallant men."&mdash;<b>Page <a href="#Page_390">390</a>.</b></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon we got to Wilmington, and leaving the
"dinkey" with one of the gun-boats, according to Capt. Young's
order, and my negro crew at the Provost Marshal's office, I went
immediately to Gen. Terry's headquarters, and delivered my
dispatches. He received me very kindly, and satisfied all my
wants, and gave me a fresh supply of ammunition. The same
dispatch had already arrived a few hours before me by two of
Gen. Howard's scouts&mdash;a sergeant Amich, and a man whose
name I do not recollect. Their route was much shorter than
mine, and they beat me through half a day. They had made the
trip in the disguise of rebel officers, and met with no opposition,
though they often met pickets, and squads of men on the way.</p>

<p>My journey by the river, however, was an important one, as
by that means the practicability of ascending it with gun-boats
was established. I was fully able to report every obstruction on
the stream, and informed the commanders of the fleet that at
Elizabeth was an immense raft, which the rebels deemed sufficient
to check the progress of the boats; but that hope turned out
a delusion. At some points, they had the river nearly blocked
up by trees, which they had chopped into it; but the inevitable
Yankee couldn't be stopped.</p>

<p>My work, however, was not done when I reached Wilmington,
as I had yet other dispatches to deliver to Gen. Schofield, at
Newbern, or Kingston; and as my orders were to proceed to the
former place by sea, Gen. Dodge gave me transportation on the
Weybossett, a very large vessel loaded with soldiers.</p>

<p>While off the coast, we experienced a severe storm, and though
the waves did not roll "mountains high," or anything like it,
they did rise about twenty feet, which was sufficient to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
everything about the ship crack, and to put me out of all fancy
for sea traveling. Everybody on board, of course, was sea-sick,
except a few chaps who, I observed, were plunging about in
heavy boots, pea-jackets, and uncouth looking hats; and who
were chiefly employed in pulling, first at this rope, and then at
that, as though they might have imbibed too freely of old Bourbon.
The gunwales of the boat were lined all the time with men
holding their heads over the water, and acting very much as if
they had all taken rather freely of an emetic. For my part, I
discovered that the most comfortable position I could assume,
was with my stomach across a water cask.</p>

<p>The ship didn't appear to care a cent about the muss it was
raising, but kept on, like a wild mustang, when under the saddle
for the first time; every few minutes contriving to duck down so
low that the wind would dash the water over us, which did not
greatly enhance our comfort. I will not say that it made us
more miserable, for that would be impossible; a sea-sick man
can defy all creation to add to his misery.</p>

<p>In due course of time we arrived at Morehead city, and from
there I took the cars to Newbern, and thence proceeded to
Kingston, walking the last ten miles of the way. I gave my
message to General Scofield, and then, after eating a meal, laid
down for a nap; but I had not been asleep more than three
hours, when an orderly woke me up, saying the General wanted
me. I went immediately to him, and he said he desired to have
me carry a dispatch back to General Sherman across the country;
and I took the document and started.</p>

<p>At these headquarters, I met an old scout and friend, named
McIntyre, who went five or six miles with me&mdash;a man from the
escort accompanying us to take back the horse I rode. We
parted, and they returned to the camp, while I directed my steps
through the woods toward Kenansville, and the reader may be
sure I had a long, hard tramp. My orders were to go to Faison's
Depot, on the railroad, between Wilmington and Goldsboro,
where General Scofield expected that General Sherman
would be the next Sunday; and it was a difficult job to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
through, as the rebels had the bridges and creek crossings all
picketed. I had, sometimes, to go four or five miles out of
my way to get across streams. At one point, about sixteen
miles from Faison's, I wanted something to eat, and went to a
negro cabin some distance from the road to get it; and while I
was there, one of our soldiers went down the road on about the
fastest horse, ever I saw a soldier ride; and he was making it
do its best, while close behind him were about twenty Johnnies,
in full pursuit, I soon saw, however, that the Yankee was bound
to be winner, for his horse could out run every thing the Johnnies
had. It was a pretty race, as long as I could see it; and
when the party was out of sight, I took to the woods. Fortunately
I did not travel far, till I discovered two horses tied to a
tree, and I at once made a fair "divide" with the owner&mdash;I took
one and left him the other; of course exercising my privilege of
first choice. At the first house I passed I borrowed a saddle,
and from there made good time, going at a run till I overtook
the General. He had left the depot, and was already several
miles away; and judging from the roar of artillery, was up to
his eyes in a fight. Following the direction of the heaviest
sound, I kept on, and found the General, as I expected, trying
to force the Johnnies into a decent submission to the laws of
the country. He was on the march with the 15th corps, when I
overtook him, and delivered my dispatches.</p>

<p>As the enemy did not stand long, our army went into camp
soon after my arrival, and I had the privilege of a free night's
rest&mdash;and let not the reader suppose that I needed rocking in
order to sleep.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the army was on the march early,
and in a little while began fighting with the enemy's cavalry.
I was with the advance, and we had a lively time, in which I got
several good shots; but of course the rebels had to fly. We
kept on after the retreating foe all day, skirmishing almost continually.
Our route lay in the direction of Smithfield, and in
the evening, we came upon the enemy in considerable force, and
had a warm encounter, which resulted in the capture from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of a strong line of breastworks, on Hannah's creek&mdash;they being
carried by a charge made by the 46th Ohio Infantry. The
boys went in with a spirit which was irresistible, and the Johnnies
either fell before their unerring Spencer rifles, or retreated
in shameful disorder, amid the cheers of our gallant men.</p>

<p>The army immediately went into camp, after this encounter,
and began to strengthen their position. Next morning, I went
out and skirmished a little, but on learning that a train was
to start from Kingston, that day, I returned to headquarters,
and got permission from the General to go home. As I had
served about seven months over my time, my request was readily
granted; and he further furnished me with an order to the
Adjutant General, at Washington, who immediately through his
assistant, Colonel Beck, gave me another order, directing me to
go to Columbus for muster out; and my connection with the
service, and my adventures, terminated on the 1st day of April,
1865.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>

<div class="center">PERSONAL&mdash;CONCLUSION.</div>


<p>My arduous duties, accompanied as was the peculiar branch
of the service to which I was attached, by far more than ever
the ordinary exposure of soldier life, together with the hardships
of two long terms of imprisonment in rebel slaughter pens, naturally
impaired my health greatly; though, fortunately, my maladies
were only of a trifling nature, and a few months at home
leaves me once more able and willing to respond to a second call
to serve my country, should the necessity again arise to marshall
an army for its defense&mdash;which, I trust, may never be the
case. As for the war of the rebellion&mdash;that practically ended
with the surrender of Lee; and with it is settled the whole question
of secession. Henceforth, no man will be so idle as to
dream of place and power through disunion; and no man will
dare to raise his hand against this government, which is emphatically
the great champion of freedom.</p>

<p>The Union of the States&mdash;that is to be perpetual; the last
rays of the setting sun, on the day that time ceases to be, must
fall upon our nation united, and able to cope with all mankind,
and only succumbing to the decrees of Heaven. Let malcontents
reconcile themselves to this fact. Patriotic heads have
decreed that treason shall never again rear its head; and patriots
are ready to enforce this decree, as they have already enforced
it, at fearful cost.</p>

<p>I have ever endeavored to do my duty faithfully, and will
never shrink from meeting any man who is a foe to my country.
I chose the occupation of a scout, because it was suited to my
nature, and because, while preferring those duties, I was independent,
and could suit my actions to my will. While in the
army directly, there was more restraint than suited me; but my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
duties as a scout, though accompanied by cold, hunger, and danger,
were ever a pleasure. The more the risk accompanying an
expedition, the greater was my ambition to undertake it.</p>

<p>My reward has been rich. I gained the confidence of officers,
and the respect of comrades; and this was all I ever desired,
and all I received, except on two occasions. One of these was
when Gen. Grant paid me a hundred dollars for running the
Muscle shoals; and the other was on leaving the army, on the
21st of March, when Gen. Sherman gave me a like sum for navigating
the Cape Fear river to Wilmington.</p>

<p>Many of the occurrences I have related may be hard to believe;
some may even regard them as wholly fictitious; but
those who have seen service in this way, whether officer or soldier,
will scarcely question them; as there is scarcely a man
who has been in the army but has experienced more or less of
adventure, equally startling and romantic.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to be vain, nor to parade the good opinions
which others have entertained regarding me, before the world;
but for the benefit of those who know nothing of my character
for veracity, I beg leave to append the following documentary
evidence, relating to my career:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Headquarters 4th O. V. Cavalry</span>,<br />

</div>

<p>"<i>To his Excellency David Tod, Governor of Ohio</i>:</p>

<p>"I have the honor to respectfully recommend to your notice for promotion
Corporal James Pike, of the 4th O. V. Cavalry, who has been a member
of the regiment since September, 1861. He has, by strict attention to
his duties, and by meritorious conduct in various engagements, richly
earned a commission. He has also been engaged at different times in secret
service, thereby gaining a great deal of valuable information, which
has been highly beneficial to the Government.</p>

<div class="right">
"Respectfully yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">O. P. Robie</span>,<br />
"Lieut. Col. Commanding, 4th O. V. Cavalry."<br /><br />

<blockquote>

</div>

<p>"Corporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Pike is well known to almost every commander in this Department
for the invaluable services he has rendered as a scout and on
secret service. He has been with me for some two months, sometimes
performing the most dangerous services. I have always found him intelligent,
energetic, zealous, and possessed of a high sense of honor; and in
every way calculated to make an excellent officer. I hope, if consistent
with the Governor's views, this promotion will be made as a slight acknowledgement
of Corporal Pike's past services.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Dep. Cumberland</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Chattanooga, Feb. 15, 1864.</span>
</div>

<p>"Respectfully forwarded and recommended. I have known Corporal
Pike for a long time as an energetic, capable, and conscientious man, and
believe he would make a good officer.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Nashville, Tenn., March 14, 1864</span>.
</div>

<p>"The recommendation of Gen. Thomas is cordially concurred in by me.
Corporal Pike has proved himself brave and energetic, and I believe would
make an efficient commissioned officer.</p>

<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">U. S. Grant</span>,<br />
"Lieut. General."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>General Sherman, who is a man of few words, and who is not
readily imposed upon while acting in a military capacity, gave
me the following, which is in his usual terse and comprehensive
style:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Trust the bearer.</p>
<div class="right">
"<span class="smcap">W. T. Sherman</span>,<br />
"Major General."<br />
</div>
<p>"March 8, 1865."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not enter the fearful contest, which raged so unremittingly
for four years, from any sectional prejudices. I fought no man
because he was a <i>Southerner</i>, but because he was a <i>rebel</i>. I hated
secession, but have ever loved and been ready to protect the loyal
men of the South. The war was not of my seeking, but was the
inevitable result of the fact that those who entertained a certain
class of principles were unwilling to submit to the arbitrament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
of reason. The secessionists forced the contest upon the country,
and I had but to choose the cause I would espouse. In
every conflict there is a right and a wrong side; and when the
war began I chose the right. When I enlisted, I fully resolved
never to abandon the struggle, if my life was spared, till the
great wrong, beneath which the country was suffering, should be
righted; and if the work of rendering every foot of my native
country free, has not yet been accomplished, I am ready to
fight again.</p>

<p>When once it is determined to engage in a war, it is the part
of mercy and humanity to wage it with all the energy a belligerent
possesses. The more sanguinary the conflict, the shorter
will be its duration, and the sooner peace will be restored to
bless the land. The more lives lost in battle, the fewer the victims
of camp life; and a sharp and decisive campaign is far less
wasting to an army than one of idleness and inactivity.</p>

<p>Hoping that our country has endured its last great trial; that
perpetual peace and prosperity may bless its people, and that
henceforth reason, and not passion, may be the arbiter of all differences,
I bid the generous reader a kind<br /></p>
